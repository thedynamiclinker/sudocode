## The "begat" list: How to fast forward the story to 20XY

- [ ] Cantor: Shows vulnerability.
- [ ] Russell: Exploits vulnerability.
- [ ] Hilbert: Organizes bounty.
- [ ] Trinity: Church, Göd, Martyr.
- [ ] Apostles & Epistles:
  - [ ] Steve Kleene (next to Gödeliness). Cleaned up Gödel's "first code ever written" and disseminated the Gödel and Turing senses of computation to the world. Original programmer in Lambda calculus under Church.
  - [ ] John νon Neumann (Neumann János Lajos) the superhuman. Gave a definition of Ordinals that superseded Cantor's definition. Axiomatized Cantor's set theory for his PhD thesis. Studied under David Hilbert. Persistent self doubts, thought Gödel would be remembered with Pythagoras while he would be forgotten. Nobel Laureate Hans Bethe said "I have sometimes wondered whether a brain like von Neumann's does not indicate a species superior to that of man." Go to Accolades on Wikipedia page. Quote: von Neumann "was the first to have a vision of the boundless possibilities of computing, and he had the resolve to gather the considerable intellectual and engineering resources that led to the construction of the first large computer"
- [ ] Trinity begets three spirits: λ, μ, ν.

- [ ] λ thread: Language, Large, Lisp.
- [ ] Church & Steve influence McCarthy.
- [ ] MacCarthy creates Lisp (λ, ν)
- [ ] Lisp inspires ISWIM and ML. (λ)
- [ ] ML inspires the Haskell group (λ)
- [ ] Haskell group: Simon, Philip. John Backus as God. The New Testament of the lambda.
- [ ] Coq, Idris, Agda: the theorem provers.
- [ ] Finally: λμν merge in: Lean. The foundational people begin to reach the mathematicians. Mathlib is born. Kevin spreads the word to the normal mathematicians. Tao converted, begins to use @2 (ν) in Lean (λ) to explore pure mathematics founded on a non-human mind (μ).

- [ ] μ thread: Metal, Micro.
- [ ] Göd & Martyr influence Von Neumann. Martyr is Turing with bits of Post and Gödel. Mental illness and madness mixed with brilliance.
- [ ] ENIAC built in 1945. "However, instead of the stored-program computers that exist today, ENIAC was just a large collection of arithmetic machines, which originally had programs set up into the machine by a combination of plugboard wiring and three portable function tables (containing 1,200 ten-way switches each)."
- [ ] Von Neumann meets Herman Goldstine, creator of ENIAC, in 1944. Writes " First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC." Builds IAS machine from 1946 to 1951. The μ family is now under way.
- [ ] Unix thread and Ken live here.
- [ ] Most of the book probably takes place here.
- [ ] Finally: λμν merge in: Nix and Wnix. The classical μ system (Unix) meets the lambda school to become NixOS and combined with @2 creates Wnix.

- [ ] ν thread: Neuro, New.
- [ ] Began with Turing's paper on the Imitation game.
- [ ] Led to McCullough and Pitts (Pitts was a logician). Pitts was an amazing character and should be covered. See personal life and death section of wikipedia page. He's clearly one of the Foundational People.
- [ ] Rumelhart and McClelland PDP.
- [ ] Geoff Hinton's 40 years in the desert.
- [ ] Finally: λμν merge in: Unclear. We have the clear meeting of μ and ν with Alexnet, transformers, and GPT, once it becomes practical to run these programs on conventional machines with the addition of GPUs. Tensorflow is now moving in a more functional direction with Jax, but not sure how to make that timeless. To be continued.
