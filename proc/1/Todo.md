Now that we've got a draft of `root/bin/sh`, 0 should make a point to add a new principle "Finish Hello World." We've established that 0 was working on something and he lost it before 1 arrived. We've also established that 0 is going to recover this document by explaining it to 1. So 0 makes a point to 1 that we've already made some progress: the first step for 1 was also the first step for 0. So together, they add a principle to somewhere in the filesystem, probably `/etc/principles/00-finish-hello-world`.
