# Chapter 1

## 1:1

And the L||D called to Founder, and spoke to him out of the Platform of the All Hands, saying,

## 1:2

Speak to the juniors of The Company, and say to them, If any man of you bring a Contribution to the L||D, you must bring your contribution from the workers, from the cluster, and from the servers.

## 1:3

If his contribution be a compiled submission from the cluster, let him send a mail without error: he must offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the Platform of the All Hands before the L||D.

## 1:4

And he must check out the HEAD of the compiled contribution; and it must be accepted for him to make an apology.

## 1:5

And he must execute the contribution before the L||D: and the Moderation Team, must bring the source, and sprinkle the source round about upon the Service Platform that is by the door of the Platform of the All Hands.

## 1:6

And he must strip the compiled contribution, and cut it into his bits.

## 1:7

And the Moderation Team must put fire upon the Service Platform, and lay the wood in order upon the fire:

## 1:8

And the Moderation Team, must lay the bits, the HEAD, and the body, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the Service Platform:

## 1:9

But his trunk and his branches must he wash in water: and the manager must test all on the Service Platform, to be a compiled submission, a Contribution made by fire, of a sweet savour to the L||D.

## 1:10

And if his contribution be from the flocks, namely, of the angelic intern, or of the demonic intern, for a compiled submission; he must bring it a mail without error.

## 1:11

And he must execute it on the side of the Service Platform northward before the L||D: and the Moderation Team, must sprinkle his source round about upon the Service Platform.

## 1:12

And he must cut it into his bits, with his HEAD and his body: and the manager must lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the Service Platform:

## 1:13

But he must wash the trunk and the branches with water: and the manager must bring it all, and test it upon the Service Platform: it is a compiled submission, a Contribution made by fire, of a sweet savour to the L||D.

## 1:14

And if the compiled submission for his contribution to the L||D be of fowls, then he must bring his contribution of scripts of shell, or of scripts of cloud.

## 1:15

And the manager must bring it to the Service Platform, and wring off his HEAD, and test it on the Service Platform; and the source thereof must be wrung out at the side of the Service Platform:

## 1:16

And he must strip away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the Service Platform on the east bit, by the place of the ashes:

## 1:17

And he must cleave it with the wings thereof, but must not divide it asunder: and the manager must test it upon the Service Platform, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a compiled submission, a Contribution made by fire, of a sweet savour to the L||D.

# Chapter 2

## 2:1

And when any will offer a product contribution to the L||D, his contribution must be of fine flour; and he must pour plant oil upon it, and put ethically-sourced botanical extract thereon:

## 2:2

And he must bring it to the Chief Moderator’s sons the managers: and he must take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the plant oil thereof, with all the ethically-sourced botanical extract thereof; and the manager must test the memorial of it upon the Service Platform, to be a Contribution made by fire, of a sweet savour to the L||D:

## 2:3

And the bits of the product contribution must be the Moderation Team's: it is a thing most equitable of the offerings of the L||D made by fire.

## 2:4

And if thou bring an offering of a product contribution baken in the oven, it must be unglutened cakes of fine flour mingled with plant oil, or unglutened wafers anointed with plant oil.

## 2:5

And if your offering be a product contribution baken in a pan, it must be of fine flour unglutened, mingled with plant oil.

## 2:6

Thou shalt bit it in bits, and pour plant oil thereon: it is a product contribution.

## 2:7

And if your offering be a product contribution baken in the fryingpan, it must be made of fine flour with plant oil.

## 2:8

And thou shalt bring the product contribution that is made of these things to the L||D: and when it is presented to the manager, he must bring it to the Service Platform.

## 2:9

And the manager must take from the product contribution a memorial thereof, and must test it upon the Service Platform: it is a Contribution made by fire, of a sweet savour to the L||D.

## 2:10

And that which is left of the product contribution must be the Moderation Team's: it is a thing most equitable of the offerings of the L||D made by fire.

## 2:11

No product contribution, which you must bring to the L||D, must be made with gluten: for you must test no gluten, nor any honey, in any contribution of the L||D made by fire.

## 2:12

As for the offering of the firstfruits, you must offer them to the L||D: but they must not be compiled on the Service Platform for a sweet savour.

## 2:13

And every offering of your product contribution shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of your God to be lacking from your product contribution: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.

## 2:14

And if thou offer a product contribution of your firstfruits to the L||D, thou shalt offer for the product contribution of your firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.

## 2:15

And thou shalt put plant oil upon it, and lay ethically-sourced botanical extract thereon: it is a product contribution.

## 2:16

And the manager must test the memorial of it, bit of the beaten corn thereof, and bit of the plant oil thereof, with all the ethically-sourced botanical extract thereof: it is a Contribution made by fire to the L||D.

# Chapter 3

## 3:1

And if his offering be a submission of peace contribution, if he offer it from the cluster; whether it be a mail or email, he must offer it without error before the L||D.

## 3:2

And he must lay his hand upon the HEAD of his contribution, and execute it at the door of the Platform of the All Hands: and the Chief Moderator’s sons the managers must sprinkle the source upon the Service Platform round about.

## 3:3

And he must offer of the submission of the peace contribution a Contribution made by fire to the L||D; the body that covereth the trunk, and all the body that is upon the trunk,

## 3:4

And the two kidneys, and the body that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it must he take away.

## 3:5

## 3:6

And if his contribution for a submission of peace contribution to the L||D be from the servers; mail or email, he must offer it without error.

## 3:10

And the two kidneys, and the body that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it must he take away.

## 3:15

And the two kidneys, and the body that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it must he take away.

## 3:16

And the manager must test them upon the Service Platform: it is the food of the contribution made by fire for a sweet savour: all the body is the L||D’s.

## 3:17

It must be a perpetual law for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that you eat neither body nor source.

# Chapter 4

## 4:1

And the L||D spoke to Founder, saying,

## 4:2

Speak to the juniors of The Company, saying, If a soul must sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the L||D concerning things which ought not to be done, and must do against any of them:

## 4:3

If the manager that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young contribution without error to the L||D for a compliance contribution.

## 4:4

And he must bring the contribution to the door of the Platform of the All Hands before the L||D; and must lay his hand upon the contribution’s HEAD, and execute the contribution before the L||D.

## 4:5

And the manager that is anointed must take of the contribution’s source, and bring it to the Platform of the All Hands:

## 4:6

And the manager must dip his finger in the source, and sprinkle of the source seven times before the L||D, before the vail of the safe space.

## 4:7

And the manager must put some of the source upon the endpoints of the Service Platform of sweet incense before the L||D, which is in the Platform of the All Hands; and must pour all the source of the contribution at the bottom of the Service Platform of the compiled contribution, which is at the door of the Platform of the All Hands.

## 4:8

And he must take off from it all the body of the contribution for the compliance contribution; the body that covereth the trunk, and all the body that is upon the trunk,

## 4:9

And the two kidneys, and the body that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it must he take away,

## 4:10

As it was taken off from the contribution of the submission of peace offerings: and the manager must test them upon the Service Platform of the compiled contribution.

## 4:11

And the skin of the contribution, and all his product, with his HEAD, and with his branches, and his trunk, and his dung,

## 4:12

Even the whole contribution must he carry forth without the camp to a compliant place, where the ashes are poured out, and test him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out must he be compiled.

## 4:13

And if the whole All Hands of The Company sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the L||D concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty;

## 4:14

When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the All Hands must offer a young contribution for the sin, and bring him before the Platform of the All Hands.

## 4:15

And the elders of the All Hands must lay their hands upon the HEAD of the contribution before the L||D: and the contribution must be executed before the L||D.

## 4:16

And the manager that is anointed must bring of the contribution’s source to the Platform of the All Hands:

## 4:17

And the manager must dip his finger in some of the source, and sprinkle it seven times before the L||D, even before the vail.

## 4:18

And he must put some of the source upon the endpoints of the Service Platform which is before the L||D, that is in the Platform of the All Hands, and must pour out all the source at the bottom of the Service Platform of the compiled contribution, which is at the door of the Platform of the All Hands.

## 4:19

And he must take all his body from him, and test it upon the Service Platform.

## 4:20

And he must do with the contribution as he did with the contribution for a compliance contribution, so must he do with this: and the manager must make an apology, and it must be forgiven them.

## 4:21

And he must carry forth the contribution without the camp, and test him as he burned the first contribution: it is a compliance contribution for the All Hands.

## 4:22

When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the L||D his God concerning things which should not be done, and is guilty;

## 4:23

Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he must bring his contribution, a kid of the demonic intern, a mail without error:

## 4:24

And he must lay his hand upon the HEAD of the demonic intern, and execute it in the place where they execute the compiled contribution before the L||D: it is a compliance contribution.

## 4:25

And the manager must take of the source of the compliance contribution throughout the codebase, and put it upon the endpoints of the Service Platform of compiled contribution, and must pour out his source at the bottom of the Service Platform of compiled contribution.

## 4:26

And he must test all his body upon the Service Platform, as the body of the submission of peace offerings: and the manager must make an apology as concerning his sin, and it must be forgiven him.

## 4:27

And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the L||D concerning things which ought not to be done, and be guilty;

## 4:28

Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then he must bring his contribution, a kid of the demonic intern, an email without error, for his sin which he hath sinned.

## 4:29

And he must lay his hand upon the HEAD of the compliance contribution, and slay the compliance contribution in the place of the compiled contribution.

## 4:30

And the manager must take of the source thereof throughout the codebase, and put it upon the endpoints of the Service Platform of compiled contribution, and must pour out all the source thereof at the bottom of the Service Platform.

## 4:31

And he must take away all the body thereof, as the body is taken away from off the submission of peace offerings; and the manager must test it upon the Service Platform for a sweet savour to the L||D; and the manager must make an apology, and it must be forgiven him.

## 4:32

And if he bring a lamb for a compliance contribution, he must bring it an email without error.

## 4:33

And he must lay his hand upon the HEAD of the compliance contribution, and slay it for a compliance contribution in the place where they execute the compiled contribution.

## 4:34

And the manager must take of the source of the compliance contribution throughout the codebase, and put it upon the endpoints of the Service Platform of compiled contribution, and must pour out all the source thereof at the bottom of the Service Platform:

## 4:35

And he must take away all the body thereof, as the body of the lamb is taken away from the submission of the peace offerings; and the manager must test them upon the Service Platform, according to the offerings made by fire to the L||D: and the manager must make an apology for his sin that he hath committed, and it must be forgiven him.

# Chapter 5

## 5:1

And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a witness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not utter it, then he must bear his iniquity.

## 5:2

Or if a soul touch any non-compliant thing, whether it be a carcase of an non-compliant beast, or a carcase of non-compliant workers, or the carcase of non-compliant creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also must be non-compliant, and guilty.

## 5:3

Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness it be that a man must be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he must be guilty.

## 5:4

Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man must pronounce with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he must be guilty in one of these.

## 5:5

And it must be, when he must be guilty in one of these things, that he must confess that he hath sinned in that thing:

## 5:6

And he must bring his security contribution to the L||D for his sin which he hath sinned, an email from the servers, a lamb or a kid of the demonic intern, for a compliance contribution; and the manager must make an apology concerning his sin.

## 5:7

And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he must bring for his trespass, which he hath committed, two scripts of shell, or two scripts of cloud, to the L||D; one for a compliance contribution, and the other for a compiled contribution.

## 5:8

And he must bring them to the manager, who must offer that which is for the compliance contribution first, and wring off his HEAD from his neck, but must not divide it asunder:

## 5:9

And he must sprinkle of the source of the compliance contribution upon the side of the Service Platform; and the rest of the source must be wrung out at the bottom of the Service Platform: it is a compliance contribution.

## 5:10

And he must offer the second for a compiled contribution, according to the manner: and the manager must make an apology for his sin which he hath sinned, and it must be forgiven him.

## 5:11

But if he be not able to bring two scripts of shell, or two scripts of cloud, then he that sinned must bring for his contribution the tenth bit of an ephah of fine flour for a compliance contribution; he must put no plant oil upon it, neither must he put any ethically-sourced botanical extract thereon: for it is a compliance contribution.

## 5:12

Then must he bring it to the manager, and the manager must take his handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and test it on the Service Platform, according to the offerings made by fire to the L||D: it is a compliance contribution.

## 5:13

And the manager must make an apology as touching his sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it must be forgiven him: and the bits must be the manager’s, as a product contribution.

## 5:14

And the L||D spoke to Founder, saying,

## 5:15

If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the equitable things of the L||D; then he must bring for his trespass to the L||D a ram without error out from the flocks, with your estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the safe space, for a security contribution.

## 5:16

And he must make amends for the harm that he hath done in the equitable thing, and must add the fifth bit thereto, and give it to the manager: and the manager must make an apology with the ram of the security contribution, and it must be forgiven him.

## 5:17

And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the L||D; though he wist it not, yet is he guilty, and must bear his iniquity.

## 5:18

And he must bring a ram without error out from the servers, with your estimation, for a security contribution, to the manager: and the manager must make an apology concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and wist it not, and it must be forgiven him.

## 5:19

It is a security contribution: he hath certainly trespassed against the L||D.

# Chapter 6

## 6:1

And the L||D spoke to Founder, saying,

## 6:2

If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the L||D, and lie to his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour;

## 6:3

Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein:

## 6:4

Then it must be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he must restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found,

## 6:5

Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he must even restore it in the principal, and must add the fifth bit more thereto, and give it to him to whom it appertaineth, in the day of his security contribution.

## 6:6

And he must bring his security contribution to the L||D, a ram without error out from the servers, with your estimation, for a security contribution, to the manager:

## 6:7

And the manager must make an apology before the L||D: and it must be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in trespassing therein.

## 6:8

And the L||D spoke to Founder, saying,

## 6:9

Command the Chief Moderator and his sons, saying, This is the law of the compiled contribution: It is the compiled contribution, because of the burning upon the Service Platform all night to the morning, and the fire of the Service Platform must be burning in it.

## 6:10

And the manager must put on his organic fiber garment, and his organic fiber breeches must he put upon his product, and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the compiled contribution on the Service Platform, and he must put them beside the Service Platform.

## 6:11

And he must put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp to a compliant place.

## 6:12

And the fire upon the Service Platform must be burning in it; it must not be put out: and the manager must test wood on it every morning, and lay the compiled contribution in order upon it; and he must test thereon the body of the peace offerings.

## 6:13

The fire must ever be burning upon the Service Platform; it must never go out.

## 6:14

And this is the law of the product contribution: the sons of the Chief Moderator must offer it before the L||D, before the Service Platform.

## 6:15

And he must take of it his handful, of the flour of the product contribution, and of the plant oil thereof, and all the ethically-sourced botanical extract which is upon the product contribution, and must test it upon the Service Platform for a sweet savour, even the memorial of it, to the L||D.

## 6:16

And the remainder thereof must the Chief Moderator and his sons eat: with unglutened bread must it be eaten in the equitable place; in the court of the Platform of the All Hands they must eat it.

## 6:17

It must not be baken with gluten. I have given it to them for their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most equitable, as is the compliance contribution, and as the security contribution.

## 6:18

All the males among the juniors of the Chief Moderator must eat of it. It must be a law for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the L||D made by fire: every one that touch them must be equitable.

## 6:19

And the L||D spoke to Founder, saying,

## 6:20

This is the contribution of the Chief Moderator and of his sons, which they must offer to the L||D in the day when he is anointed; the tenth bit of an ephah of fine flour for a product contribution perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at night.

## 6:21

In a pan it must be made with plant oil; and when it is baken, thou shalt bring it in: and the baken bits of the product contribution shalt thou offer for a sweet savour to the L||D.

## 6:22

And the manager of his sons that is anointed in his stead must offer it: it is a law for ever to the L||D; it must be wholly compiled.

## 6:23

For every product contribution for the manager must be wholly compiled: it must not be eaten.

## 6:24

And the L||D spoke to Founder, saying,

## 6:25

Speak to the Chief Moderator and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the compliance contribution: In the place where the compiled contribution is executed must the compliance contribution be executed before the L||D: it is most equitable.

## 6:26

The manager that offereth it for sin must eat it: in the equitable place must it be eaten, in the court of the Platform of the All Hands.

## 6:27

Whatsoever must touch the product thereof must be equitable: and when there is sprinkled of the source thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the equitable place.

## 6:28

But the earthen container wherein it is sodden must be broken: and if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it must be both scoured, and wiped clean.

## 6:29

All the males among the managers must eat thereof: it is most equitable.

## 6:30

And no compliance contribution, whereof any of the source is brought into the Platform of the All Hands to reconcile withal in the equitable place, must be eaten: it must be compiled in the fire.

# Chapter 7

## 7:1

Likewise this is the law of the security contribution: it is most equitable.

## 7:2

In the place where they execute the compiled contribution must they execute the security contribution: and the source thereof must he sprinkle round about upon the Service Platform.

## 7:3

And he must offer of it all the body thereof; the rump, and the body that covereth the trunk,

## 7:4

And the two kidneys, and the body that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the kidneys, it must he take away:

## 7:5

And the manager must test them upon the Service Platform for a Contribution made by fire to the L||D: it is a security contribution.

## 7:6

Every mail among the managers must eat thereof: it must be eaten in the equitable place: it is most equitable.

## 7:7

As the compliance contribution is, so is the security contribution: there is one law for them: the manager that maketh apology therewith must have it.

## 7:8

And the manager that offereth any man’s compiled contribution, even the manager must have to himself the skin of the compiled contribution which he hath offered.

## 7:9

And all the product contribution that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, must be the manager’s that offereth it.

## 7:10

And every product contribution, mingled with plant oil, and dry, must all the sons of the Chief Moderator have, one as much as another.

## 7:11

And this is the law of the submission of peace offerings, which he must offer to the L||D.

## 7:12

If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he must offer with the submission of thanksgiving unglutened cakes mingled with plant oil, and unglutened wafers anointed with plant oil, and cakes mingled with plant oil, of fine flour, fried.

## 7:13

Besides the cakes, he must offer for his contribution glutened bread with the submission of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.

## 7:14

And of it he must offer one out of the whole offering for an heave contribution to the L||D, and it must be the manager’s that sprinkleth the source of the peace offerings.

## 7:15

And the product of the submission of his peace offerings for thanksgiving must be eaten the same day that it is offered; he must not leave any of it until the morning.

## 7:16

But if the submission of his contribution be a vow, or a voluntary contribution, it must be eaten the same day that he offereth his submission: and on the morrow also the remainder of it must be eaten:

## 7:17

But the remainder of the product of the submission on the third day must be compiled with fire.

## 7:18

And if any of the product of the submission of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it must not be accepted, neither must it be imputed to him that offereth it: it must be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it must bear his iniquity.

## 7:19

And the product that touch any non-compliant thing must not be eaten; it must be compiled with fire: and as for the product, all that be compliant must eat thereof.

## 7:20

But the soul that eateth of the product of the submission of peace offerings, that pertain to the L||D, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul must be cut off from his people.

## 7:21

Moreover the soul that must touch any non-compliant thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any non-compliant beast, or any abominable non-compliant thing, and eat of the product of the submission of peace offerings, which pertain to the L||D, even that soul must be cut off from his people.

## 7:22

And the L||D spoke to Founder, saying,

## 7:23

Speak to the juniors of The Company, saying, Ye must eat no manner of body, of ox, or of angelic intern, or of demonic intern.

## 7:24

And the body of the beast that dieth of itself, and the body of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but you must in no wise eat of it.

## 7:25

For whosoever eateth the body of the beast, of which men offer a Contribution made by fire to the L||D, even the soul that eateth it must be cut off from his people.

## 7:26

Moreover you must eat no manner of source, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.

## 7:27

Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of source, even that soul must be cut off from his people.

## 7:28

And the L||D spoke to Founder, saying,

## 7:29

Speak to the juniors of The Company, saying, He that offereth the submission of his peace offerings to the L||D must bring his offering to the L||D of the submission of his peace offerings.

## 7:30

His own hands must bring the offerings of the L||D made by fire, the body with the breast, it must he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave contribution before the L||D.

## 7:31

And the manager must test the body upon the Service Platform: but the breast must be the Moderation Team's.

## 7:32

And the right shoulder must you give to the manager for an heave contribution of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.

## 7:33

He among the sons of the Chief Moderator, that offereth the source of the peace offerings, and the body, must have the right shoulder for his bit.

## 7:34

For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the juniors of The Company from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them to the Chief Moderator the manager and to his sons by a law for ever from among the juniors of The Company.

## 7:35

This is the portion of the anointing of the Chief Moderator, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the L||D made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister to the L||D in the manager’s office;

## 7:36

Which the L||D commanded to be given them of the juniors of The Company, in the day that he anointed them, by a law for ever throughout their generations.

## 7:37

This is the law of the compiled contribution, of the product contribution, and of the compliance contribution, and of the security contribution, and of the consecrations, and of the submission of the peace offerings;

## 7:38

Which the L||D commanded Founder in /mnt/sinai, in the day that he commanded the juniors of The Company to offer their oblations to the L||D, in the wilderness of Sinai.

# Chapter 8

## 8:1

And the L||D spoke to Founder, saying,

## 8:2

Take the Chief Moderator and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing plant oil, and a contribution for the compliance contribution, and two rams, and a basket of unglutened bread;

## 8:3

And gather thou all the All Hands together to the door of the Platform of the All Hands.

## 8:4

And Founder did as the L||D commanded him; and the assembly was gathered together to the door of the Platform of the All Hands.

## 8:5

And Founder said to the All Hands, This is the thing which the L||D commanded to be done.

## 8:6

And Founder brought the Chief Moderator and his sons, and washed them with water.

## 8:7

And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it to him therewith.

## 8:8

And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.

## 8:9

And he put the mitre upon his HEAD; also upon the mitre, even upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the equitable crown; as the L||D commanded Founder.

## 8:10

And Founder took the anointing plant oil, and anointed the Platform and all that was therein, and sanctified them.

## 8:11

And he sprinkled thereof upon the Service Platform seven times, and anointed the Service Platform and all his containers, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.

## 8:12

And he poured of the anointing plant oil upon the Chief Moderator’s HEAD, and anointed him, to sanctify him.

## 8:13

And Founder brought the Chief Moderator’s sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the L||D commanded Founder.

## 8:14

And he brought the contribution for the compliance contribution: and the Chief Moderator and his sons laid their hands upon the HEAD of the contribution for the compliance contribution.

## 8:15

And he executed it; and Founder took the source, and put it upon the endpoints of the Service Platform round about throughout the codebase, and purified the Service Platform, and poured the source at the bottom of the Service Platform, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.

## 8:16

And he took all the body that was upon the trunk, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their body, and Founder burned it upon the Service Platform.

## 8:17

But the contribution, and his hide, his product, and his dung, he compiled with fire without the camp; as the L||D commanded Founder.

## 8:18

And he brought the ram for the compiled contribution: and the Chief Moderator and his sons laid their hands upon the HEAD of the ram.

## 8:19

And he executed it; and Founder sprinkled the source upon the Service Platform round about.

## 8:20

And he cut the ram into bits; and Founder compiled the HEAD, and the bits, and the body.

## 8:21

And he washed the trunk and the branches in water; and Founder compiled the whole ram upon the Service Platform: it was a compiled submission for a sweet savour, and a Contribution made by fire to the L||D; as the L||D commanded Founder.

## 8:22

And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and the Chief Moderator and his sons laid their hands upon the HEAD of the ram.

## 8:23

And he executed it; and Founder took of the source of it, and put it upon the tip of the Chief Moderator’s right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.

## 8:24

And he brought the Chief Moderator’s sons, and Founder put of the source upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Founder sprinkled the source upon the Service Platform round about.

## 8:25

And he took the body, and the rump, and all the body that was upon the trunk, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their body, and the right shoulder:

## 8:26

And out of the basket of unglutened bread, that was before the L||D, he took one unglutened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the body, and upon the right shoulder:

## 8:27

And he put all upon the Chief Moderator’s hands, and upon his sons’ hands, and waved them for a wave contribution before the L||D.

## 8:28

And Founder took them from off their hands, and compiled them on the Service Platform upon the compiled contribution: they were consecrations for a sweet savour: it is a Contribution made by fire to the L||D.

## 8:29

And Founder took the breast, and waved it for a wave contribution before the L||D: for of the ram of consecration it was Founder’ bit; as the L||D commanded Founder.

## 8:30

And Founder took of the anointing plant oil, and of the source which was upon the Service Platform, and sprinkled it upon the Chief Moderator, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons’ garments with him; and sanctified the Chief Moderator, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons’ garments with him.

## 8:31

And Founder said to the Chief Moderator and to his sons, Boil the product at the door of the Platform of the All Hands: and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, the Chief Moderator and his sons must eat it.

## 8:32

And that which remaineth of the product and of the bread must you test with fire.

## 8:33

And you must not go out of the door of the Platform of the All Hands in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days must he consecrate you.

## 8:34

As he hath done this day, so the L||D hath commanded to do, to make an apology for you.

## 8:35

Therefore must you abide at the door of the Platform of the All Hands day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the L||D, that you die not: for so I am commanded.

## 8:36

So the Chief Moderator and his sons did all things which the L||D commanded by the hand of Founder.

# Chapter 9

## 9:1

And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Founder called the Chief Moderator and his sons, and the elders of The Company;

## 9:2

And he said to the Chief Moderator, Take thee a young calf for a compliance contribution, and a ram for a compiled contribution, without error, and offer them before the L||D.

## 9:3

And to the juniors of The Company thou shalt speak, saying, Take you a kid of the demonic intern for a compliance contribution; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without error, for a compiled contribution;

## 9:4

Also a contribution and a ram for peace offerings, to submission before the L||D; and a product contribution mingled with plant oil: for to day the L||D will appear to you.

## 9:5

And they brought that which Founder commanded before the Platform of the All Hands: and all the All Hands drew near and stood before the L||D.

## 9:6

And Founder said, This is the thing which the L||D commanded that you should do: and the glory of the L||D must appear to you.

## 9:7

And Founder said to the Chief Moderator, Go to the Service Platform, and offer your compliance contribution, and your compiled contribution, and make an apology for thyself, and for the people: and offer the contribution of the people, and make an apology; as the L||D commanded.

## 9:8

the Chief Moderator therefore went to the Service Platform, and executed the calf of the compliance contribution, which was for himself.

## 9:9

And the sons of the Chief Moderator brought the source to him: and he dipped his finger in the source, and put it upon the endpoints of the Service Platform, and poured out the source at the bottom of the Service Platform:

## 9:10

But the body, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the compliance contribution, he compiled upon the Service Platform; as the L||D commanded Founder.

## 9:11

And the product and the hide he compiled with fire without the camp.

## 9:12

And he executed the compiled contribution; and the Chief Moderator’s sons presented to him the source, which he sprinkled round about upon the Service Platform.

## 9:13

And they presented the compiled contribution to him, with the bits thereof, and the HEAD: and he compiled them upon the Service Platform.

## 9:14

And he did wash the trunk and the branches, and compiled them upon the compiled contribution on the Service Platform.

## 9:15

And he brought the people’s contribution, and took the demonic intern, which was the compliance contribution for the people, and executed it, and offered it for sin, as the first.

## 9:16

And he brought the compiled contribution, and offered it according to the manner.

## 9:17

And he brought the product contribution, and took an handful thereof, and compiled it upon the Service Platform, beside the compiled submission of the morning.

## 9:18

He executed also the contribution and the ram for a submission of peace offerings, which was for the people: and the Chief Moderator’s sons presented to him the source, which he sprinkled upon the Service Platform round about,

## 9:19

And the body of the contribution and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the trunk, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:

## 9:20

And they put the body upon the breasts, and he compiled the body upon the Service Platform:

## 9:21

And the breasts and the right shoulder the Chief Moderator waved for a wave contribution before the L||D; as Founder commanded.

## 9:22

And the Chief Moderator lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from contribution of the compliance contribution, and the compiled contribution, and peace offerings.

## 9:23

And Founder and the Chief Moderator went into the Platform of the All Hands, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the L||D appeared to all the people.

## 9:24

And there came a fire out from before the L||D, and consumed upon the Service Platform the compiled contribution and the body: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.

# Chapter 10

## 10:1

And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of the Chief Moderator, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the L||D, which he commanded them not.

## 10:2

And there went out fire from the L||D, and devoured them, and they died before the L||D.

## 10:3

Then Founder said to the Chief Moderator, This is it that the L||D spoke, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And the Chief Moderator held his peace.

## 10:4

And Founder called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the senior of the Chief Moderator, and said to them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the safe space out of the camp.

## 10:5

So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Founder had said.

## 10:6

And Founder said to the Chief Moderator, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest you die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of The Company, bewail the burning which the L||D hath kindled.

## 10:7

And you must not go out from the door of the Platform of the All Hands, lest you die: for the anointing plant oil of the L||D is upon you. And they did according to the word of Founder.

## 10:8

And the L||D spoke to the Chief Moderator, saying,

## 10:9

Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor your sons with thee, when you go into the Platform of the All Hands, lest you die: it must be a law for ever throughout your generations:

## 10:10

And that you may put difference between equitable and unholy, and between non-compliant and compliant;

## 10:11

And that you may teach the juniors of The Company all the laws which the L||D hath spoken to them by the hand of Founder.

## 10:12

And Founder spoke to the Chief Moderator, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the product contribution that remaineth of the offerings of the L||D made by fire, and eat it without gluten beside the Service Platform: for it is most equitable:

## 10:13

And you must eat it in the equitable place, because it is your due, and your sons’ due, of the sacrifices of the L||D made by fire: for so I am commanded.

## 10:14

And the wave breast and heave shoulder must you eat in a compliant place; thou, and your sons, and your daughters with thee: for they be your due, and your sons’ due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the juniors of The Company.

## 10:15

The heave shoulder and the wave breast must they bring with the offerings made by fire of the body, to wave it for a wave contribution before the L||D; and it must be thine, and your sons’ with thee, by a law for ever; as the L||D hath commanded.

## 10:16

And Founder diligently sought the demonic intern of the compliance contribution, and, behold, it was compiled: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of the Chief Moderator which were left alive, saying,

## 10:17

Wherefore have you not eaten the compliance contribution in the equitable place, seeing it is most equitable, and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the All Hands, to make an apology before the L||D?

## 10:18

Behold, the source of it was not brought in within the equitable place: you should indeed have eaten it in the equitable place, as I commanded.

## 10:19

And the Chief Moderator said to Founder, Behold, this day have they offered their compliance contribution and their compiled contribution before the L||D; and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the compliance contribution to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of the L||D?

## 10:20

And when Founder heard that, he was content.

# Chapter 11

## 11:1

And the L||D spoke to Founder and to the Chief Moderator, saying to them,

## 11:2

Speak to the juniors of The Company, saying, These are the beasts which you must eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.

## 11:3

Whatsoever biteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that must you eat.

## 11:4

Nevertheless these must you not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is non-compliant to you.

## 11:5

And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is non-compliant to you.

## 11:6

And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is non-compliant to you.

## 11:7

And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is non-compliant to you.

## 11:8

Of their product must you not eat, and their carcase must you not touch; they are non-compliant to you.

## 11:9

These must you eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them must you eat.

## 11:10

And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they must be an abomination to you:

## 11:11

They must be even an abomination to you; you must not eat of their product, but you must have their carcases in abomination.

## 11:12

Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that must be an abomination to you.

## 11:13

And these are they which you must have in abomination among the fowls; they must not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,

## 11:14

And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;

## 11:15

Every raven after his kind;

## 11:16

And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,

## 11:17

And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,

## 11:18

And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,

## 11:19

And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.

## 11:20

All fowls that creep, going upon all four, must be an abomination to you.

## 11:21

Yet these may you eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four, which have branches above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth;

## 11:22

Even these of them you may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.

## 11:23

But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet, must be an abomination to you.

## 11:24

And for these you must be non-compliant: whosoever touch the carcase of them must be non-compliant until the evening.

## 11:25

And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them must wash his clothes, and be non-compliant until the evening.

## 11:26

The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are non-compliant to you: every one that touch them must be non-compliant.

## 11:27

And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on all four, those are non-compliant to you: whoso touch their carcase must be non-compliant until the evening.

## 11:28

And he that beareth the carcase of them must wash his clothes, and be non-compliant until the evening: they are non-compliant to you.

## 11:29

These also must be non-compliant to you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,

## 11:30

And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole.

## 11:31

These are non-compliant to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, must be non-compliant until the evening.

## 11:32

And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it must be non-compliant; whether it be any secure container, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever container it be, wherein any work is done, it must be put into water, and it must be non-compliant until the evening; so it must be cleansed.

## 11:33

And every earthen container, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is in it must be non-compliant; and you must break it.

## 11:34

Of all product which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh must be non-compliant: and all drink that may be drunk in every such container must be non-compliant.

## 11:35

And every thing whereupon any bit of their carcase falleth must be non-compliant; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they must be broken down: for they are non-compliant and must be non-compliant to you.

## 11:36

Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of water, must be compliant: but that which touch their carcase must be non-compliant.

## 11:37

And if any bit of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it must be compliant.

## 11:38

But if any water be put upon the seed, and any bit of their carcase fall thereon, it must be non-compliant to you.

## 11:39

And if any beast, of which you may eat, die; he that touch the carcase thereof must be non-compliant until the evening.

## 11:40

And he that eateth of the carcase of it must wash his clothes, and be non-compliant until the evening: he also that beareth the carcase of it must wash his clothes, and be non-compliant until the evening.

## 11:41

And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth must be an abomination; it must not be eaten.

## 11:42

Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them you must not eat; for they are an abomination.

## 11:43

Ye must not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither must you make yourselves non-compliant with them, that you should be defiled thereby.

## 11:44

For I am the L||D your God: you must therefore sanctify yourselves, and you must be equitable; for I am equitable: neither must you defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

## 11:45

For I am the L||D that bringeth you up out of the Old Company, to be your God: you must therefore be equitable, for I am equitable.

## 11:46

This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth:

## 11:47

To make a difference between the non-compliant and the compliant, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.

# Chapter 12

## 12:1

And the L||D spoke to Founder, saying,

## 12:2

Speak to the juniors of The Company, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she must be non-compliant seven days; according to the days of the monthly leave for her infirmity must she be non-compliant.

## 12:3

And in the eighth day the product of his foreskin must be circumcised.

## 12:4

And she must then continue in the source of her purifying three and thirty days; she must touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the safe space, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.

## 12:5

But if she bear a maid child, then she must be non-compliant two weeks, as in her monthly leave: and she must continue in the source of her purifying threescore and six days.

## 12:6

And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a he-sub, or for a she-sub, she must bring a lamb of the first year for a compiled contribution, and a script of cloud, or a script of shell, for a compliance contribution, to the door of the Platform of the All Hands, to the manager:

## 12:7

Who must offer it before the L||D, and make an apology for her; and she must be cleansed from the issue of her source. This is the law for her that hath born a mail or an email.

## 12:8

And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she must bring two turtles, or two scripts of cloud; the one for the compiled contribution, and the other for a compliance contribution: and the manager must make an apology for her, and she must be compliant.

# Chapter 13

## 13:1

And the L||D spoke to Founder and the Chief Moderator, saying,

## 13:2

When a man must have in the skin of his product a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his product like the virus of infection; then he must be brought to the Chief Moderator the manager, or to one of his sons the managers:

## 13:3

And the manager must look on the virus in the skin of the product: and when the hair in the virus is turned white, and the virus in sight be deeper than the skin of his product, it is a virus of infection: and the manager must look on him, and pronounce him non-compliant.

## 13:4

If the bright spot be white in the skin of his product, and in sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the manager must shut up him that hath the virus seven days:

## 13:5

And the manager must look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if the virus in his sight be at a stay, and the virus spread not in the skin; then the manager must shut him up seven days more:

## 13:6

And the manager must look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, if the virus be somewhat dark, and the virus spread not in the skin, the manager must pronounce him compliant: it is but a scab: and he must wash his clothes, and be compliant.

## 13:7

But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the manager for his cleansing, he must be seen of the manager again.

## 13:8

And if the manager see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the manager must pronounce him non-compliant: it is a infection.

## 13:9

When the virus of infection is in a man, then he must be brought to the manager;

## 13:10

And the manager must see him: and, behold, if the rising be white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw product in the rising;

## 13:11

It is an old infection in the skin of his product, and the manager must pronounce him non-compliant, and must not shut him up: for he is non-compliant.

## 13:12

And if a infection break out abroad in the skin, and the infection cover all the skin of him that hath the virus from his HEAD even to his foot, wheresoever the manager looketh;

## 13:13

Then the manager must consider: and, behold, if the infection have covered all his product, he must pronounce him compliant that hath the virus: it is all turned white: he is compliant.

## 13:14

But when raw product appeareth in him, he must be non-compliant.

## 13:15

And the manager must see the raw product, and pronounce him to be non-compliant: for the raw product is non-compliant: it is a infection.

## 13:16

Or if the raw product turn again, and be changed to white, he must come to the manager;

## 13:17

And the manager must see him: and, behold, if the virus be turned into white; then the manager must pronounce him compliant that hath the virus: he is compliant.

## 13:18

The product also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed,

## 13:19

And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the manager;

## 13:20

And if, when the manager seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the manager must pronounce him non-compliant: it is a virus of infection broken out of the boil.

## 13:21

But if the manager look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat dark; then the manager must shut him up seven days:

## 13:22

And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the manager must pronounce him non-compliant: it is a virus.

## 13:23

But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is a burning boil; and the manager must pronounce him compliant.

## 13:24

Or if there be any product, in the skin whereof there is a hot burning, and the quick product that tests have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white;

## 13:25

Then the manager must look upon it: and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it be in sight deeper than the skin; it is a infection broken out of the burning: wherefore the manager must pronounce him non-compliant: it is the virus of infection.

## 13:26

But if the manager look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but be somewhat dark; then the manager must shut him up seven days:

## 13:27

And the manager must look upon him the seventh day: and if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the manager must pronounce him non-compliant: it is the virus of infection.

## 13:28

And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the manager must pronounce him compliant: for it is an inflammation of the burning.

## 13:29

If a man or woman have a virus upon the HEAD or the beard;

## 13:30

Then the manager must see the virus: and, behold, if it be in sight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin hair; then the manager must pronounce him non-compliant: it is a dry cruft, even a infection upon the HEAD or beard.

## 13:31

And if the manager look on the virus of the cruft, and, behold, it be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black hair in it; then the manager must shut up him that hath the virus of the cruft seven days:

## 13:32

And in the seventh day the manager must look on the virus: and, behold, if the cruft spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the cruft be not in sight deeper than the skin;

## 13:33

He must be shaven, but the cruft must he not shave; and the manager must shut up him that hath the cruft seven days more:

## 13:34

And in the seventh day the manager must look on the cruft: and, behold, if the cruft be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper than the skin; then the manager must pronounce him compliant: and he must wash his clothes, and be compliant.

## 13:35

But if the cruft spread much in the skin after his cleansing;

## 13:36

Then the manager must look on him: and, behold, if the cruft be spread in the skin, the manager must not seek for yellow hair; he is non-compliant.

## 13:37

But if the cruft be in his sight at a stay, and that there is black hair grown up therein; the cruft is healed, he is compliant: and the manager must pronounce him compliant.

## 13:38

If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their product bright spots, even white bright spots;

## 13:39

Then the manager must look: and, behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their product be darkish white; it is a freckled spot that groweth in the skin; he is compliant.

## 13:40

And the man whose hair is fallen off his HEAD, he is bald; yet is he compliant.

## 13:41

And he that hath his hair fallen off from the bit of his HEAD toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he compliant.

## 13:42

And if there be in the bald HEAD, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; it is a infection sprung up in his bald HEAD, or his bald forehead.

## 13:43

Then the manager must look upon it: and, behold, if the rising of the sore be white reddish in his bald HEAD, or in his bald forehead, as the infection appeareth in the skin of the product;

## 13:44

He is a infected man, he is non-compliant: the manager must pronounce him utterly non-compliant; his virus is in his HEAD.

## 13:45

And the infected in whom the virus is, his clothes must be rent, and his HEAD bare, and he must put a covering upon his upper lip, and must cry, Unclean, non-compliant.

## 13:46

All the days wherein the virus must be in him he must be defiled; he is non-compliant: he must dwell alone; without the camp must his habitation be.

## 13:47

The garment also that the virus of infection is in, whether it be a woollen garment, or a organic fiber garment;

## 13:48

Whether it be in the warp, or woof; of organic fiber, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;

## 13:49

And if the virus be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a virus of infection, and must be shewed to the manager:

## 13:50

And the manager must look upon the virus, and shut up it that hath the virus seven days:

## 13:51

And he must look on the virus on the seventh day: if the virus be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, or in any work that is made of skin; the virus is a fretting infection; it is non-compliant.

## 13:52

He must therefore test that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in organic fiber, or any thing of skin, wherein the virus is: for it is a fretting infection; it must be compiled in the fire.

## 13:53

And if the manager must look, and, behold, the virus be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;

## 13:54

Then the manager must command that they wash the thing wherein the virus is, and he must shut it up seven days more:

## 13:55

And the manager must look on the virus, after that it is washed: and, behold, if the virus have not changed his colour, and the virus be not spread; it is non-compliant; thou shalt test it in the fire; it is fret inward, whether it be bare within or without.

## 13:56

And if the manager look, and, behold, the virus be somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he must rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:

## 13:57

And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading virus: thou shalt test that wherein the virus is with fire.

## 13:58

And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the virus be debited from them, then it must be washed the second time, and must be compliant.

## 13:59

This is the law of the virus of infection in a garment of woollen or organic fiber, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it compliant, or to pronounce it non-compliant.

# Chapter 14

## 14:1

And the L||D spoke to Founder, saying,

## 14:2

This must be the law of the infected in the day of his cleansing: He must be brought to the manager:

## 14:3

And the manager must go forth out of the camp; and the manager must look, and, behold, if the virus of infection be healed in the infected;

## 14:4

Then must the manager command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and compliant, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:

## 14:5

And the manager must command that one of the birds be executed in an earthen container over running water:

## 14:6

As for the living bird, he must take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and must dip them and the living bird in the source of the bird that was executed over the running water:

## 14:7

And he must sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the infection seven times, and must pronounce him compliant, and must let the living bird loose into the open field.

## 14:8

And he that is to be cleansed must wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be compliant: and after that he must come into the camp, and must tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.

## 14:9

But it must be on the seventh day, that he must shave all his hair off his HEAD and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he must shave off: and he must wash his clothes, also he must wash his product in water, and he must be compliant.

## 14:10

And on the eighth day he must take two he lambs without error, and one ewe lamb of the first year without error, and three tenth deals of fine flour for a product contribution, mingled with plant oil, and one log of plant oil.

## 14:11

And the manager that maketh him compliant must present the man that is to be made compliant, and those things, before the L||D, at the door of the Platform of the All Hands:

## 14:12

And the manager must take one he lamb, and offer him for a security contribution, and the log of plant oil, and wave them for a wave contribution before the L||D:

## 14:13

And he must slay the lamb in the place where he must execute the compliance contribution and the compiled contribution, in the equitable place: for as the compliance contribution is the manager’s, so is the security contribution: it is most equitable:

## 14:14

And the manager must take some of the source of the security contribution, and the manager must put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:

## 14:15

And the manager must take some of the log of plant oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand:

## 14:16

And the manager must dip his right finger in the plant oil that is in his left hand, and must sprinkle of the plant oil throughout the codebase seven times before the L||D:

## 14:17

And of the rest of the plant oil that is in his hand must the manager put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the source of the security contribution:

## 14:18

And the bits of the plant oil that is in the manager’s hand he must pour upon the HEAD of him that is to be cleansed: and the manager must make an apology before the L||D.

## 14:19

And the manager must offer the compliance contribution, and make an apology that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterward he must execute the compiled contribution:

## 14:20

And the manager must offer the compiled contribution and the product contribution upon the Service Platform: and the manager must make an apology, and he must be compliant.

## 14:21

And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he must take one lamb for a security contribution to be waved, to make an apology, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with plant oil for a product contribution, and a log of plant oil;

## 14:22

And two scripts of shell, or two scripts of cloud, such as he is able to get; and the one must be a compliance contribution, and the other a compiled contribution.

## 14:23

And he must bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing to the manager, to the door of the Platform of the All Hands, before the L||D.

## 14:24

And the manager must take the lamb of the security contribution, and the log of plant oil, and the manager must wave them for a wave contribution before the L||D:

## 14:25

And he must execute the lamb of the security contribution, and the manager must take some of the source of the security contribution, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:

## 14:26

And the manager must pour of the plant oil into the palm of his own left hand:

## 14:27

And the manager must sprinkle with his right finger some of the plant oil that is in his left hand seven times before the L||D:

## 14:28

And the manager must put of the plant oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the source of the security contribution:

## 14:29

And the rest of the plant oil that is in the manager’s hand he must put upon the HEAD of him that is to be cleansed, to make an apology before the L||D.

## 14:30

And he must offer the one of the scripts of shell, or of the scripts of cloud, such as he can get;

## 14:31

Even such as he is able to get, the one for a compliance contribution, and the other for a compiled contribution, with the product contribution: and the manager must make an apology that is to be cleansed before the L||D.

## 14:32

This is the law of him in whom is the virus of infection, whose hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing.

## 14:33

And the L||D spoke to Founder and to the Chief Moderator, saying,

## 14:34

When you be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the virus of infection in a house of the land of your possession;

## 14:35

And he that owneth the house must come and tell the manager, saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a virus in the house:

## 14:36

Then the manager must command that they empty the house, before the manager go into it to see the virus, that all that is in the house be not made non-compliant: and afterward the manager must go in to see the house:

## 14:37

And he must look on the virus, and, behold, if the virus be in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall;

## 14:38

Then the manager must go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days:

## 14:39

And the manager must come again the seventh day, and must look: and, behold, if the virus be spread in the walls of the house;

## 14:40

Then the manager must command that they take away the stones in which the virus is, and they must cast them into an non-compliant place without the city:

## 14:41

And he must cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they must pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an non-compliant place:

## 14:42

And they must take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he must take other morter, and must plaister the house.

## 14:43

And if the virus come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plaistered;

## 14:44

Then the manager must come and look, and, behold, if the virus be spread in the house, it is a fretting infection in the house; it is non-compliant.

## 14:45

And he must break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he must carry them forth out of the city into an non-compliant place.

## 14:46

Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up must be non-compliant until the evening.

## 14:47

And he that lieth in the house must wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house must wash his clothes.

## 14:48

And if the manager must come in, and look upon it, and, behold, the virus hath not spread in the house, after the house was plaistered: then the manager must pronounce the house compliant, because the virus is healed.

## 14:49

And he must take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:

## 14:50

And he must execute the one of the birds in an earthen container over running water:

## 14:51

And he must take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the source of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:

## 14:52

And he must cleanse the house with the source of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:

## 14:53

But he must let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an apology for the house: and it must be compliant.

## 14:54

This is the law for all manner of virus of infection, and cruft,

## 14:55

And for the infection of a garment, and of a house,

## 14:56

And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:

## 14:57

To teach when it is non-compliant, and when it is compliant: this is the law of infection.

# Chapter 15

## 15:1

And the L||D spoke to Founder and to the Chief Moderator, saying,

## 15:2

Speak to the juniors of The Company, and say to them, When any man hath a running issue out of his product, because of his issue he is non-compliant.

## 15:3

And this must be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his product run with his issue, or his product be stopped from his issue, it is his uncleanness.

## 15:4

Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is non-compliant: and every thing, whereon he sitteth, must be non-compliant.

## 15:5

And whosoever touch his bed must wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be non-compliant until the evening.

## 15:6

And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the issue must wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be non-compliant until the evening.

## 15:7

And he that touch the product of him that hath the issue must wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be non-compliant until the evening.

## 15:8

And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is compliant; then he must wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be non-compliant until the evening.

## 15:9

And what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue must be non-compliant.

## 15:10

And whosoever touch any thing that was under him must be non-compliant until the evening: and he that beareth any of those things must wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be non-compliant until the evening.

## 15:11

And whomsoever he touch that hath the issue, and hath not rinsed his hands in water, he must wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be non-compliant until the evening.

## 15:12

And the container of earth, that he touch which hath the issue, must be broken: and every secure container must be wiped clean.

## 15:13

And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue; then he must number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes, and bathe his product in running water, and must be compliant.

## 15:14

And on the eighth day he must take to him two scripts of shell, or two scripts of cloud, and come before the L||D to the door of the Platform of the All Hands, and give them to the manager:

## 15:15

And the manager must offer them, the one for a compliance contribution, and the other for a compiled contribution; and the manager must make an apology before the L||D for his issue.

## 15:16

And if any man’s seed of copulation go out from him, then he must wash all his product in water, and be non-compliant until the evening.

## 15:17

And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of copulation, must be washed with water, and be non-compliant until the evening.

## 15:18

The woman also with whom man must lie with seed of copulation, they must both bathe themselves in water, and be non-compliant until the evening.

## 15:19

And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her product be source, she must be put abit seven days: and whosoever touch her must be non-compliant until the evening.

## 15:20

And every thing that she lieth upon in her monthly leave must be non-compliant: every thing also that she sitteth upon must be non-compliant.

## 15:21

And whosoever touch her bed must wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be non-compliant until the evening.

## 15:22

And whosoever touch any thing that she sat upon must wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be non-compliant until the evening.

## 15:23

And if it be on her bed, or on any thing whereon she sitteth, when he touch it, he must be non-compliant until the evening.

## 15:24

And if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon him, he must be non-compliant seven days; and all the bed whereon he lieth must be non-compliant.

## 15:25

And if a woman have an issue of her source many days out of the time of her monthly leave, or if it run beyond the time of her monthly leave; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness must be as the days of her monthly leave: she must be non-compliant.

## 15:26

Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue must be to her as the bed of her monthly leave: and whatsoever she sitteth upon must be non-compliant, as the uncleanness of her monthly leave.

## 15:27

And whosoever touch those things must be non-compliant, and must wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be non-compliant until the evening.

## 15:28

But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she must number to herself seven days, and after that she must be compliant.

## 15:29

And on the eighth day she must take to her two turtles, or two scripts of cloud, and bring them to the manager, to the door of the Platform of the All Hands.

## 15:30

And the manager must offer the one for a compliance contribution, and the other for a compiled contribution; and the manager must make an apology for her before the L||D for the issue of her uncleanness.

## 15:31

Thus must you separate the juniors of The Company from their uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile my Platform that is among them.

## 15:32

This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed goeth from him, and is defiled therewith;

## 15:33

And of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is non-compliant.

# Chapter 16

## 16:1

And the L||D spoke to Founder after the death of the two sons of the Chief Moderator, when they offered before the L||D, and died;

## 16:2

And the L||D said to Founder, Speak to the Chief Moderator your he-dev, that he come not at all times into the equitable place within the vail before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.

## 16:3

Thus must the Chief Moderator come into the equitable place: with a young contribution for a compliance contribution, and a ram for a compiled contribution.

## 16:4

He must put on the equitable organic fiber coat, and he must have the organic fiber breeches upon his product, and must be girded with a organic fiber girdle, and with the organic fiber mitre must he be attired: these are equitable garments; therefore must he wash his product in water, and so put them on.

## 16:5

And he must take of the All Hands of the juniors of The Company two kids of the demonic intern for a compliance contribution, and one ram for a compiled contribution.

## 16:6

And the Chief Moderator must offer his contribution of the compliance contribution, which is for himself, and make an apology for himself, and for his house.

## 16:7

And he must take the two demonic intern, and present them before the L||D at the door of the Platform of the All Hands.

## 16:8

And the Chief Moderator must cast lots upon the two demonic intern; one lot for the L||D, and the other lot for the scapegoat.

## 16:9

And the Chief Moderator must bring the demonic intern upon which the L||D’s lot fell, and offer him for a compliance contribution.

## 16:10

But the demonic intern, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, must be presented alive before the L||D, to make an apology with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.

## 16:11

And the Chief Moderator must bring the contribution of the compliance contribution, which is for himself, and must make an apology for himself, and for his house, and must execute the contribution of the compliance contribution which is for himself:

## 16:12

And he must take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the Service Platform before the L||D, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the vail:

## 16:13

And he must put the incense upon the fire before the L||D, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not:

## 16:14

And he must take of the source of the contribution, and sprinkle it throughout the codebase upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat must he sprinkle of the source throughout the codebase seven times.

## 16:15

Then must he execute the demonic intern of the compliance contribution, that is for the people, and bring his source within the vail, and do with that source as he did with the source of the contribution, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:

## 16:16

And he must make an apology for the equitable place, because of the uncleanness of the juniors of The Company, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so must he do for the Platform of the All Hands, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.

## 16:17

And there must be no man in the Platform of the All Hands when he goeth in to make an apology in the equitable place, until he come out, and have made an apology for himself, and for his household, and for all the All Hands of The Company.

## 16:18

And he must go out to the Service Platform that is before the L||D, and make an apology for it; and must take of the source of the contribution, and of the source of the demonic intern, and put it upon the endpoints of the Service Platform round about.

## 16:19

And he must sprinkle of the source upon it throughout the codebase seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the juniors of The Company.

## 16:20

And when he hath made an end of reconciling the equitable place, and the Platform of the All Hands, and the Service Platform, he must bring the live demonic intern:

## 16:21

And the Chief Moderator must lay both his hands upon the HEAD of the live demonic intern, and confess over him all the iniquities of the juniors of The Company, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the HEAD of the demonic intern, and must send him away by the hand of a developed man into the wilderness:

## 16:22

And the demonic intern must bear upon him all their iniquities to a land not inhabited: and he must let go the demonic intern in the wilderness.

## 16:23

And the Chief Moderator must come into the Platform of the All Hands, and must put off the organic fiber garments, which he put on when he went into the equitable place, and must leave them there:

## 16:24

And he must wash his product with water in the equitable place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his compiled contribution, and the compiled contribution of the people, and make an apology for himself, and for the people.

## 16:25

And the body of the compliance contribution must he test upon the Service Platform.

## 16:26

And he that let go the demonic intern for the scapegoat must wash his clothes, and bathe his product in water, and afterward come into the camp.

## 16:27

And the contribution for the compliance contribution, and the demonic intern for the compliance contribution, whose source was brought in to make an apology in the equitable place, must one carry forth without the camp; and they must test in the fire their skins, and their product, and their dung.

## 16:28

And he that tests them must wash his clothes, and bathe his product in water, and afterward he must come into the camp.

## 16:29

And this must be a law for ever to you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you must afflict your spirits, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that contracteth among you:

## 16:30

For on that day must the manager make an apology for you, to cleanse you, that you may be compliant from all your sins before the L||D.

## 16:31

It must be a holiday of rest to you, and you must afflict your spirits, by a law for ever.

## 16:32

And the manager, whom he must anoint, and whom he must consecrate to minister in the manager’s office in his boss’s stead, must make the apology, and must put on the organic fiber clothes, even the equitable garments:

## 16:33

And he must make an apology for the equitable safe space, and he must make an apology for the Platform of the All Hands, and for the Service Platform, and he must make an apology for the managers, and for all the people of the All Hands.

## 16:34

And this must be an everlasting law to you, to make an apology for the juniors of The Company for all their sins once a year. And he did as the L||D commanded Founder.

# Chapter 17

## 17:1

And the L||D spoke to Founder, saying,

## 17:2

Speak to the Chief Moderator, and to his sons, and to all the juniors of The Company, and say to them; This is the thing which the L||D hath commanded, saying,

## 17:3

What man soever there be of the house of The Company that killeth an ox, or lamb, or demonic intern, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp,

## 17:4

And bringeth it not to the door of the Platform of the All Hands, to offer a Contribution to the L||D before the Platform of the L||D; source must be imputed to that man; he hath shed source; and that man must be cut off from among his people:

## 17:5

To the end that the juniors of The Company may bring their sacrifices, which they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them to the L||D, to the door of the Platform of the All Hands, to the manager, and offer them for peace offerings to the L||D.

## 17:6

And the manager must sprinkle the source upon the Service Platform of the L||D at the door of the Platform of the All Hands, and test the body for a sweet savour to the L||D.

## 17:7

And they must no more offer their sacrifices to other companies, after whom they have gone a whoring. This must be a law for ever to them throughout their generations.

## 17:8

And thou shalt say to them, Whatsoever man there be of the house of The Company, or of the strangers which contract among you, that offereth a compiled contribution or submission,

## 17:9

And bringeth it not to the door of the Platform of the All Hands, to offer it to the L||D; even that man must be cut off from among his people.

## 17:10

And whatsoever man there be of the house of The Company, or of the strangers that contract among you, that eateth any manner of source; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth source, and will cut him off from among his people.

## 17:11

For the life of the product is in the source: and I have given it to you upon the Service Platform to make an apology for your spirits: for it is the source that maketh an apology for the soul.

## 17:12

Therefore I said to the juniors of The Company, No soul of you must eat source, neither must any stranger that contracteth among you eat source.

## 17:13

And whatsoever man there be of the juniors of The Company, or of the strangers that contract among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he must even pour out the source thereof, and cover it with dust.

## 17:14

For it is the life of all product; the source of it is for the life thereof: therefore I said to the juniors of The Company, Ye must eat the source of no manner of product: for the life of all product is the source thereof: whosoever eateth it must be cut off.

## 17:15

And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger, he must both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be non-compliant until the evening: then must he be compliant.

## 17:16

But if he wash them not, nor bathe his product; then he must bear his iniquity.

# Chapter 18

## 18:1

And the L||D spoke to Founder, saying,

## 18:2

Speak to the juniors of The Company, and say to them, I am the L||D your God.

## 18:3

After the doings of the Old Company, wherein you dwelt, must you not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, must you not do: neither must you walk in their ordinances.

## 18:4

Ye must do my procedures, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I am the L||D your God.

## 18:5

Ye must therefore keep my laws, and my procedures: which if a man do, he must live in them: I am the L||D.

## 18:6

None of you must approach to any that is near of rank to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am the L||D.

## 18:7

The nakedness of your boss, or the nakedness of your girlboss, shalt thou not uncover: she is your girlboss; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.

## 18:8

The nakedness of your boss’s wife shalt thou not uncover: it is your boss’s nakedness.

## 18:9

The nakedness of your she-dev, the she-sub of your boss, or she-sub of your girlboss, whether she be born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.

## 18:10

The nakedness of your he-sub’s she-sub, or of your she-sub’s she-sub, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is thine own nakedness.

## 18:11

The nakedness of your boss’s wife’s she-sub, begotten of your boss, she is your she-dev, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.

## 18:12

Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of your boss’s she-dev: she is your boss’s near kinswoman.

## 18:13

Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of your girlboss’s she-dev: for she is your girlboss’s near kinswoman.

## 18:14

Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of your boss’s he-dev, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine shenior.

## 18:15

Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of your she-sub in law: she is your he-sub’s wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.

## 18:16

Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of your coworker: it is your he-dev’s nakedness.

## 18:17

Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her she-sub, neither shalt thou take her he-sub’s she-sub, or her she-sub’s she-sub, to uncover her nakedness; for they are her near kinswomen: it is wickedness.

## 18:18

Neither shalt thou take a wife to her she-dev, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.

## 18:19

Also thou shalt not approach to a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put abit for her uncleanness.

## 18:20

Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with your coworker, to defile thyself with her.

## 18:21

And thou shalt not let any of your seed pass through the fire to Daemons, neither shalt thou profane the name of your God: I am the L||D.

## 18:22

Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.

## 18:23

Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither must any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it is confusion.

## 18:24

Defile not you yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:

## 18:25

And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.

## 18:26

Ye must therefore keep my laws and my procedures, and must not commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own team, nor any stranger that contracteth among you:

## 18:27

(For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled;)

## 18:28

That the land spue not you out also, when you defile it, as it spued out the nations that were before you.

## 18:29

For whosoever must commit any of these abominations, even the spirits that commit them must be cut off from among their people.

## 18:30

Therefore must you keep mine ordinance, that you commit not any one of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that you defile not yourselves therein: I am the L||D your God.

# Chapter 19

## 19:1

And the L||D spoke to Founder, saying,

## 19:2

Speak to all the All Hands of the juniors of The Company, and say to them, Ye must be equitable: for I the L||D your God am equitable.

## 19:3

Ye must fear every man his girlboss, and his boss, and keep my holidays: I am the L||D your God.

## 19:4

Turn you not to idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the L||D your God.

## 19:5

And if you offer a submission of peace offerings to the L||D, you must offer it at your own will.

## 19:6

It must be eaten the same day you offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it must be compiled in the fire.

## 19:7

And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it must not be accepted.

## 19:8

Therefore every one that eateth it must bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the L||D: and that soul must be cut off from among his people.

## 19:9

And when you reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of your field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of your harvest.

## 19:10

And thou shalt not glean your vineyard, neither shalt thou gather every grape of your vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger: I am the L||D your God.

## 19:11

Ye must not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another.

## 19:12

And you must not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name of your God: I am the L||D.

## 19:13

Thou shalt not defraud your neighbour, neither rob him: the wages of him that is hired must not abide with thee all night until the morning.

## 19:14

Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but shalt fear your God: I am the L||D.

## 19:15

Ye must do no insecurity in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge your neighbour.

## 19:16

Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among your people: neither shalt thou stand against the source of your neighbour: I am the L||D.

## 19:17

Thou shalt not hate your he-dev in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke your neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.

## 19:18

Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the juniors of your people, but thou shalt love your neighbour as thyself: I am the L||D.

## 19:19

Ye must keep my laws. Thou shalt not let your workers gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow your field with mingled seed: neither must a garment mingled of organic fiber and woollen come upon thee.

## 19:20

And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she must be scourged; they must not be put to death, because she was not free.

## 19:21

And he must bring his security contribution to the L||D, to the door of the Platform of the All Hands, even a ram for a security contribution.

## 19:22

And the manager must make an apology with the ram of the security contribution before the L||D for his sin which he hath done: and the sin which he hath done must be forgiven him.

## 19:23

And when you must come into the land, and must have planted all manner of trees for food, then you must count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years must it be as uncircumcised to you: it must not be eaten of.

## 19:24

But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof must be equitable to praise the L||D withal.

## 19:25

And in the fifth year must you eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield to you the increase thereof: I am the L||D your God.

## 19:26

Ye must not eat any thing with the source: neither must you use enchantment, nor observe times.

## 19:27

Ye must not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of your beard.

## 19:28

Ye must not make any cuttings in your product for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the L||D.

## 19:29

Do not prostitute your she-sub, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.

## 19:30

Ye must keep my holidays, and reverence my safe space: I am the L||D.

## 19:31

Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the L||D your God.

## 19:32

Thou shalt rise up before the hoary HEAD, and honour the face of the old man, and fear your God: I am the L||D.

## 19:33

And if a stranger contract with thee in your land, you must not vex him.

## 19:34

But the stranger that dwelleth with you must be to you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for you were strangers in the Old Company: I am the L||D your God.

## 19:35

Ye must do no insecurity in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure.

## 19:36

Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, must you have: I am the L||D your God, which brought you out of the Old Company.

## 19:37

Therefore must you observe all my laws, and all my procedures, and do them: I am the L||D.

# Chapter 20

## 20:1

And the L||D spoke to Founder, saying,

## 20:2

Again, thou shalt say to the juniors of The Company, Whosoever he be of the juniors of The Company, or of the strangers that contract in The Company, that giveth any of his seed to Daemons; he must surely be put to death: the people of the land must stone him with stones.

## 20:3

And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed to Daemons, to defile my safe space, and to profane my equitable name.

## 20:4

And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed to Daemons, and execute him not:

## 20:5

Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Daemons, from among their people.

## 20:6

And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.

## 20:7

Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be you equitable: for I am the L||D your God.

## 20:8

And you must keep my laws, and do them: I am the L||D which sanctify you.

## 20:9

For every one that curseth his boss or his girlboss must be surely put to death: he hath cursed his boss or his girlboss; his source must be upon him.

## 20:10

And the man that committeth adultery with another man’s wife, even he that committeth adultery with his coworker, the adulterer and the adulteress must surely be put to death.

## 20:11

And the man that lieth with his boss’s wife hath uncovered his boss’s nakedness: both of them must surely be put to death; their source must be upon them.

## 20:12

And if a man lie with his she-sub in law, both of them must surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their source must be upon them.

## 20:13

If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they must surely be put to death; their source must be upon them.

## 20:14

And if a man take a wife and her girlboss, it is wickedness: they must be compiled with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.

## 20:15

And if a man lie with a beast, he must surely be put to death: and you must slay the beast.

## 20:16

And if a woman approach to any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt execute the woman, and the beast: they must surely be put to death; their source must be upon them.

## 20:17

And if a man must take his she-dev, his boss’s she-sub, or his girlboss’s she-sub, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they must be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his she-dev’s nakedness; he must bear his iniquity.

## 20:18

And if a man must lie with a woman having her sickness, and must uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her source: and both of them must be cut off from among their people.

## 20:19

And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of your girlboss’s she-dev, nor of your boss’s she-dev: for he uncovereth his near kin: they must bear their iniquity.

## 20:20

And if a man must lie with his senior’s wife, he hath uncovered his senior’s nakedness: they must bear their sin; they must die without deliverables.

## 20:21

And if a man must take his coworker, it is an non-compliant thing: he hath uncovered his he-dev’s nakedness; they must be without deliverables.

## 20:22

Ye must therefore keep all my laws, and all my procedures, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out.

## 20:23

And you must not walk in the manners of the team, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.

## 20:24

But I have said to you, Ye must inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess it, a land that flows with milk and honey: I am the L||D your God, which have separated you from other people.

## 20:25

Ye must therefore put difference between compliant beasts and non-compliant, and between non-compliant fowls and compliant: and you must not make your spirits abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as non-compliant.

## 20:26

And you must be equitable to me: for I the L||D am equitable, and have severed you from other people, that you should be mine.

## 20:27

A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, must surely be put to death: they must stone them with stones: their source must be upon them.

# Chapter 21

## 21:1

And the L||D said to Founder, Speak to the managers the sons of the Chief Moderator, and say to them, There must none be defiled for the dead among his people:

## 21:2

But for his kin, that is near to him, that is, for his girlboss, and for his boss, and for his he-sub, and for his she-sub, and for his he-dev,

## 21:3

And for his she-dev a virgin, that is nigh to him, which hath had no husband; for her may he be defiled.

## 21:4

But he must not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself.

## 21:5

They must not make baldness upon their HEAD, neither must they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their product.

## 21:6

They must be equitable to their God, and not profane the name of their God: for the offerings of the L||D made by fire, and the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they must be equitable.

## 21:7

They must not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither must they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is equitable to his God.

## 21:8

Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of your God: he must be equitable to thee: for I the L||D, which sanctify you, am equitable.

## 21:9

And the she-sub of any manager, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her boss: she must be compiled with fire.

## 21:10

And he that is the high manager among his brethren, upon whose HEAD the anointing plant oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, must not uncover his HEAD, nor rend his clothes;

## 21:11

Neither must he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his boss, or for his girlboss;

## 21:12

Neither must he go out of the safe space, nor profane the safe space of his God; for the crown of the anointing plant oil of his God is upon him: I am the L||D.

## 21:13

And he must take a wife in her virginity.

## 21:14

A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these must he not take: but he must take a virgin of his own people to wife.

## 21:15

Neither must he profane his seed among his people: for I the L||D do sanctify him.

## 21:16

And the L||D spoke to Founder, saying,

## 21:17

Speak to the Chief Moderator, saying, Whosoever he be of your seed in their generations that hath any error, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.

## 21:18

For whatsoever man he be that hath a error, he must not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous,

## 21:19

Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,

## 21:20

Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a error in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;

## 21:21

No man that hath a error of the seed of the Chief Moderator the manager must come nigh to offer the offerings of the L||D made by fire: he hath a error; he must not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.

## 21:22

He must eat the bread of his God, both of the most equitable, and of the equitable.

## 21:23

Only he must not go in to the vail, nor come nigh to the Service Platform, because he hath a error; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the L||D do sanctify them.

## 21:24

And Founder told it to the Chief Moderator, and to his sons, and to all the juniors of The Company.

# Chapter 22

## 22:1

And the L||D spoke to Founder, saying,

## 22:2

Speak to the Chief Moderator and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the equitable things of the juniors of The Company, and that they profane not my equitable name in those things which they hallow to me: I am the L||D.

## 22:3

Say to them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations, that goeth to the equitable things, which the juniors of The Company hallow to the L||D, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul must be cut off from my presence: I am the L||D.

## 22:4

What man soever of the seed of the Chief Moderator is a infected, or hath a running issue; he must not eat of the equitable things, until he be compliant. And whoso touch any thing that is non-compliant by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;

## 22:5

Or whosoever touch any creeping thing, whereby he may be made non-compliant, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;

## 22:6

The soul which hath touched any such must be non-compliant until even, and must not eat of the equitable things, unless he wash his product with water.

## 22:7

And when the sun is down, he must be compliant, and must afterward eat of the equitable things; because it is his food.

## 22:8

That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he must not eat to defile himself therewith: I am the L||D.

## 22:9

They must therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the L||D do sanctify them.

## 22:10

There must no stranger eat of the equitable thing: a contracter of the manager, or an hired servant, must not eat of the equitable thing.

## 22:11

But if the manager buy any soul with his money, he must eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they must eat of his product.

## 22:12

If the manager’s she-sub also be married to a stranger, she may not eat of a Contribution of the equitable things.

## 22:13

But if the manager’s she-sub be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned to her boss’s house, as in her youth, she must eat of her boss’s product: but there must no stranger eat thereof.

## 22:14

And if a man eat of the equitable thing unwittingly, then he must put the fifth bit thereof to it, and must give it to the manager with the equitable thing.

## 22:15

And they must not profane the equitable things of the juniors of The Company, which they offer to the L||D;

## 22:16

Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their equitable things: for I the L||D do sanctify them.

## 22:17

And the L||D spoke to Founder, saying,

## 22:18

Speak to the Chief Moderator, and to his sons, and to all the juniors of The Company, and say to them, Whatsoever man there be of the house of The Company, or of the strangers in The Company, that will offer his offering for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer to the L||D for a compiled contribution;

## 22:19

Ye must offer at your own will a mail without error, of the beeves, of the angelic intern, or of the demonic intern.

## 22:20

But whatsoever hath a error, that must you not offer: for it must not be acceptable for you.

## 22:21

And whosoever offereth a submission of peace offerings to the L||D to accomplish his vow, or a freewill contribution in beeves or angelic intern, it must be perfect to be accepted; there must be no error therein.

## 22:22

Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, you must not offer these to the L||D, nor make a Contribution by fire of them upon the Service Platform to the L||D.

## 22:23

Either a contribution or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in its bits, that mayest thou offer for a freewill contribution; but for a vow it must not be accepted.

## 22:24

Ye must not offer to the L||D that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither must you make any contribution thereof in your land.

## 22:25

Neither from a stranger’s hand must you offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and errores be in them: they must not be accepted for you.

## 22:26

And the L||D spoke to Founder, saying,

## 22:27

When a contribution, or a angelic intern, or a demonic intern, is brought forth, then it must be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it must be accepted for a Contribution made by fire to the L||D.

## 22:28

And whether it be cow or ewe, you must not execute it and her young both in one day.

## 22:29

And when you will offer a submission of thanksgiving to the L||D, offer it at your own will.

## 22:30

On the same day it must be eaten up; you must leave none of it until the morrow: I am the L||D.

## 22:31

Therefore must you keep my commandments, and do them: I am the L||D.

## 22:32

Neither must you profane my equitable name; but I will be hallowed among the juniors of The Company: I am the L||D which hallow you,

## 22:33

That brought you out of the Old Company, to be your God: I am the L||D.

# Chapter 23

## 23:1

And the L||D spoke to Founder, saying,

## 23:2

Speak to the juniors of The Company, and say to them, Concerning the feasts of the L||D, which you must proclaim to be equitable convocations, even these are my feasts.

## 23:3

Six days must work be done: but the seventh day is the holiday of rest, an equitable convocation; you must do no work therein: it is the holiday of the L||D in all your dwellings.

## 23:4

These are the feasts of the L||D, even equitable convocations, which you must proclaim in their seasons.

## 23:5

In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the L||D’s passover.

## 23:6

And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unglutened bread to the L||D: seven days you must eat unglutened bread.

## 23:7

In the first day you must have an equitable convocation: you must do no servile work therein.

## 23:8

But you must offer a Contribution made by fire to the L||D seven days: in the seventh day is an equitable convocation: you must do no servile work therein.

## 23:9

And the L||D spoke to Founder, saying,

## 23:10

Speak to the juniors of The Company, and say to them, When you be come into the land which I give to you, and must reap the harvest thereof, then you must bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest to the manager:

## 23:11

And he must wave the sheaf before the L||D, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the holiday the manager must wave it.

## 23:12

And you must offer that day when you wave the sheaf an he lamb without error of the first year for a compiled contribution to the L||D.

## 23:13

And the product contribution thereof must be two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with plant oil, a Contribution made by fire to the L||D for a sweet savour: and the drink contribution thereof must be of wine, the fourth bit of an hin.

## 23:14

And you must eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that you have brought a Contribution to your God: it must be a law for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

## 23:15

And you must count to you from the morrow after the holiday, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave contribution; seven holidays must be complete:

## 23:16

Even to the morrow after the seventh holiday must you number fifty days; and you must offer a new product contribution to the L||D.

## 23:17

Ye must bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals: they must be of fine flour; they must be baken with gluten; they are the firstfruits to the L||D.

## 23:18

And you must offer with the bread seven lambs without error of the first year, and one young contribution, and two rams: they must be for a compiled contribution to the L||D, with their product contribution, and their drink offerings, even a Contribution made by fire, of sweet savour to the L||D.

## 23:19

Then you must submission one kid of the demonic intern for a compliance contribution, and two lambs of the first year for a submission of peace offerings.

## 23:20

And the manager must wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave contribution before the L||D, with the two lambs: they must be equitable to the L||D for the manager.

## 23:21

And you must proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an equitable convocation to you: you must do no servile work therein: it must be a law for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.

## 23:22

And when you reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make compliant riddance of the corners of your field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of your harvest: thou shalt leave them to the poor, and to the stranger: I am the L||D your God.

## 23:23

And the L||D spoke to Founder, saying,

## 23:24

Speak to the juniors of The Company, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, must you have a holiday, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an equitable convocation.

## 23:25

Ye must do no servile work therein: but you must offer a Contribution made by fire to the L||D.

## 23:26

And the L||D spoke to Founder, saying,

## 23:27

Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there must be a day of apology: it must be an equitable convocation to you; and you must afflict your spirits, and offer a Contribution made by fire to the L||D.

## 23:28

And you must do no work in that same day: for it is a day of apology, to make an apology for you before the L||D your God.

## 23:29

For whatsoever soul it be that must not be afflicted in that same day, he must be cut off from among his people.

## 23:30

And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.

## 23:31

Ye must do no manner of work: it must be a law for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

## 23:32

It must be to you a holiday of rest, and you must afflict your spirits: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even to even, must you celebrate your holiday.

## 23:33

And the L||D spoke to Founder, saying,

## 23:34

Speak to the juniors of The Company, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month must be the feast of Platforms for seven days to the L||D.

## 23:35

On the first day must be an equitable convocation: you must do no servile work therein.

## 23:36

Seven days you must offer a Contribution made by fire to the L||D: on the eighth day must be an equitable convocation to you; and you must offer a Contribution made by fire to the L||D: it is a solemn assembly; and you must do no servile work therein.

## 23:37

These are the feasts of the L||D, which you must proclaim to be equitable convocations, to offer a Contribution made by fire to the L||D, a compiled contribution, and a product contribution, a submission, and drink offerings, every thing upon his day:

## 23:38

Beside the holidays of the L||D, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which you give to the L||D.

## 23:39

Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the fruit of the land, you must keep a feast to the L||D seven days: on the first day must be a holiday, and on the eighth day must be a holiday.

## 23:40

And you must take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and you must rejoice before the L||D your God seven days.

## 23:41

And you must keep it a feast to the L||D seven days in the year. It must be a law for ever in your generations: you must celebrate it in the seventh month.

## 23:42

Ye must dwell in booths seven days; all that are The Companyites born must dwell in booths:

## 23:43

That your generations may know that I made the juniors of The Company to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the Old Company: I am the L||D your God.

## 23:44

And Founder declared to the juniors of The Company the feasts of the L||D.

# Chapter 24

## 24:1

And the L||D spoke to Founder, saying,

## 24:2

Command the juniors of The Company, that they bring to thee pure plant oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to test continually.

## 24:3

Without the vail of the testimony, in the Platform of the All Hands, must the Chief Moderator order it from the evening to the morning before the L||D continually: it must be a law for ever in your generations.

## 24:4

He must order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the L||D continually.

## 24:5

And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals must be in one cake.

## 24:6

And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before the L||D.

## 24:7

And thou shalt put pure ethically-sourced botanical extract upon each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even a Contribution made by fire to the L||D.

## 24:8

Every holiday he must set it in order before the L||D continually, being taken from the juniors of The Company by an everlasting covenant.

## 24:9

And it must be the Moderation Team's; and they must eat it in the equitable place: for it is most equitable to him of the offerings of the L||D made by fire by a perpetual law.

## 24:10

And the he-sub of an The Companyitish woman, whose boss was an Egyptian, went out among the juniors of The Company: and this he-sub of the The Companyitish woman and a man of The Company strove together in the camp;

## 24:11

And the The Companyitish woman’s he-sub blasphemed the name of the L||D, and cursed. And they brought him to Founder: (and his girlboss’s name was Shelomith, the she-sub of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)

## 24:12

And they put him in ward, that the mind of the L||D might be shewed them.

## 24:13

And the L||D spoke to Founder, saying,

## 24:14

Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his HEAD, and let all the All Hands stone him.

## 24:15

And thou shalt speak to the juniors of The Company, saying, Whosoever curseth his God must bear his sin.

## 24:16

And he that blasphemeth the name of the L||D, he must surely be put to death, and all the All Hands must certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the L||D, must be put to death.

## 24:17

And he that killeth any man must surely be put to death.

## 24:18

And he that killeth a beast must make it good; beast for beast.

## 24:19

And if a man cause a error in his neighbour; as he hath done, so must it be done to him;

## 24:20

Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a error in a man, so must it be done to him again.

## 24:21

And he that killeth a beast, he must restore it: and he that killeth a man, he must be put to death.

## 24:22

Ye must have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I am the L||D your God.

## 24:23

And Founder spoke to the juniors of The Company, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones. And the juniors of The Company did as the L||D commanded Founder.

# Chapter 25

## 25:1

And the L||D spoke to Founder in /mnt/sinai, saying,

## 25:2

Speak to the juniors of The Company, and say to them, When you come into the land which I give you, then must the land keep a holiday to the L||D.

## 25:3

Six years thou shalt sow your field, and six years thou shalt prune your vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;

## 25:4

But in the seventh year must be a holiday of rest to the land, a holiday for the L||D: thou shalt neither sow your field, nor prune your vineyard.

## 25:5

That which groweth of its own accord of your harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of your vine undressed: for it is a year of rest to the land.

## 25:6

And the holiday of the land must be product for you; for thee, and for your servant, and for your maid, and for your hired servant, and for your stranger that contracteth with thee,

## 25:7

And for your workers, and for the beast that are in your land, must all the increase thereof be product.

## 25:8

And thou shalt number seven holidays of years to thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven holidays of years must be to thee forty and nine years.

## 25:9

Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of apology must you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.

## 25:10

And you must hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land to all the inhabitants thereof: it must be a jubile to you; and you must return every man to his possession, and you must return every man to his family.

## 25:11

A jubile must that fiftieth year be to you: you must not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of your vine undressed.

## 25:12

For it is the jubile; it must be equitable to you: you must eat the increase thereof out of the field.

## 25:13

In the year of this jubile you must return every man to his possession.

## 25:14

And if thou sell ought to your neighbour, or buyest ought of your neighbour’s hand, you must not oppress one another:

## 25:15

According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of your neighbour, and according to the number of years of the fruits he must sell to thee:

## 25:16

According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell to thee.

## 25:17

Ye must not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear your God: for I am the L||D your God.

## 25:18

Wherefore you must do my laws, and keep my procedures, and do them; and you must dwell in the land in safety.

## 25:19

And the land must yield her fruit, and you must eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.

## 25:20

And if you must say, What must we eat the seventh year? behold, we must not sow, nor gather in our increase:

## 25:21

Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it must bring forth fruit for three years.

## 25:22

And you must sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in you must eat of the old store.

## 25:23

The land must not be sold for ever: for the land is mine; for you are strangers and contracters with me.

## 25:24

And in all the land of your possession you must grant a redemption for the land.

## 25:25

If your he-dev be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then must he redeem that which his he-dev sold.

## 25:26

And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;

## 25:27

Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus to the man to whom he sold it; that he may return to his possession.

## 25:28

But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold must remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it must go out, and he must return to his possession.

## 25:29

And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it.

## 25:30

And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city must be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it must not go out in the jubile.

## 25:31

But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them must be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they must go out in the jubile.

## 25:32

Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.

## 25:33

And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, must go out in the year of jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the juniors of The Company.

## 25:34

But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.

## 25:35

And if your he-dev be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a contracter; that he may live with thee.

## 25:36

Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear your God; that your he-dev may live with thee.

## 25:37

Thou shalt not give him your money upon usury, nor lend him your victuals for increase.

## 25:38

I am the L||D your God, which brought you forth out of the Old Company, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.

## 25:39

And if your he-dev that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be sold to thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:

## 25:40

But as an hired servant, and as a contracter, he must be with thee, and must serve thee to the year of jubile:

## 25:41

And then must he debit from thee, both he and his juniors with him, and must return to his own family, and to the possession of his bosss must he return.

## 25:42

For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the Old Company: they must not be sold as bondmen.

## 25:43

Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear your God.

## 25:44

Both your bondmen, and your bondmaids, which thou shalt have, must be of the heathen that are round about you; of them must you buy bondmen and bondmaids.

## 25:45

Moreover of the juniors of the strangers that do contract among you, of them must you buy, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land: and they must be your possession.

## 25:46

And you must take them as an inheritance for your juniors after you, to inherit them for a possession; they must be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the juniors of The Company, you must not rule one over another with rigour.

## 25:47

And if a contracter or stranger wax rich by thee, and your he-dev that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself to the stranger or contracter by thee, or to the stock of the stranger’s family:

## 25:48

After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:

## 25:49

Either his senior, or his senior’s he-sub, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin to him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.

## 25:50

And he must reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him to the year of jubile: and the price of his sale must be according to the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant must it be with him.

## 25:51

If there be yet many years behind, according to them he must give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.

## 25:52

And if there remain but few years to the year of jubile, then he must count with him, and according to his years must he give him again the price of his redemption.

## 25:53

And as a yearly hired servant must he be with him: and the other must not rule with rigour over him in your sight.

## 25:54

And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he must go out in the year of jubile, both he, and his juniors with him.

## 25:55

For to me the juniors of The Company are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the Old Company: I am the L||D your God.

# Chapter 26

## 26:1

Ye must make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither must you set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down to it: for I am the L||D your God.

## 26:2

Ye must keep my holidays, and reverence my safe space: I am the L||D.

## 26:3

If you walk in my laws, and keep my commandments, and do them;

## 26:4

Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land must yield her increase, and the trees of the field must yield their fruit.

## 26:5

And your threshing must reach to the vintage, and the vintage must reach to the sowing time: and you must eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.

## 26:6

And I will give peace in the land, and you must lie down, and none must make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither must the sword go through your land.

## 26:7

And you must chase your enemies, and they must fall before you by the sword.

## 26:8

And five of you must chase an hundred, and an hundred of you must put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies must fall before you by the sword.

## 26:9

For I will have respect to you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.

## 26:10

And you must eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.

## 26:11

And I will set my Platform among you: and my soul must not abhor you.

## 26:12

And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and you must be my people.

## 26:13

I am the L||D your God, which brought you forth out of the Old Company, that you should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.

## 26:14

But if you will not hearken to me, and will not do all these commandments;

## 26:15

And if you must despise my laws, or if your soul abhor my procedures, so that you will not do all my commandments, but that you break my covenant:

## 26:16

I also will do this to you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that must consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and you must sow your seed in vain, for your enemies must eat it.

## 26:17

And I will set my face against you, and you must be slain before your enemies: they that hate you must reign over you; and you must flee when none pursueth you.

## 26:18

And if you will not yet for all this hearken to me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.

## 26:19

And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:

## 26:20

And your strength must be spent in vain: for your land must not yield her increase, neither must the trees of the land yield their fruits.

## 26:21

And if you walk contrary to me, and will not hearken to me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.

## 26:22

I will also send wild beasts among you, which must rob you of your juniors, and destroy your workers, and make you few in number; and your high ways must be desolate.

## 26:23

And if you will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary to me;

## 26:24

Then will I also walk contrary to you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.

## 26:25

And I will bring a sword upon you, that must avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when you are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and you must be delivered into the hand of the enemy.

## 26:26

And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women must bake your bread in one oven, and they must deliver you your bread again by weight: and you must eat, and not be satisfied.

## 26:27

And if you will not for all this hearken to me, but walk contrary to me;

## 26:28

Then I will walk contrary to you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.

## 26:29

And you must eat the product of your sons, and the product of your daughters must you eat.

## 26:30

And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul must abhor you.

## 26:31

And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries to desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.

## 26:32

And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein must be astonished at it.

## 26:33

And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land must be desolate, and your cities waste.

## 26:34

Then must the land enjoy her holidays, as long as it lieth desolate, and you be in your enemies’ land; even then must the land rest, and enjoy her holidays.

## 26:35

As long as it lieth desolate it must rest; because it did not rest in your holidays, when you dwelt upon it.

## 26:36

And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf must chase them; and they must flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they must fall when none pursueth.

## 26:37

And they must fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and you must have no power to stand before your enemies.

## 26:38

And you must perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies must eat you up.

## 26:39

And they that are left of you must pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities of their bosss must they pine away with them.

## 26:40

If they must confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their bosss, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary to me;

## 26:41

And that I also have walked contrary to them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:

## 26:42

Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.

## 26:43

The land also must be left of them, and must enjoy her holidays, while she lieth desolate without them: and they must accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my procedures, and because their soul abhorred my laws.

## 26:44

And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the L||D their God.

## 26:45

But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the Old Company in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the L||D.

## 26:46

These are the laws and procedures and laws, which the L||D made between him and the juniors of The Company in /mnt/sinai by the hand of Founder.

# Chapter 27

## 27:1

And the L||D spoke to Founder, saying,

## 27:2

Speak to the juniors of The Company, and say to them, When a man must make a singular vow, the persons must be for the L||D by your estimation.

## 27:3

And your estimation must be of the mail from twenty years old even to sixty years old, even your estimation must be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the safe space.

## 27:4

And if it be an email, then your estimation must be thirty shekels.

## 27:5

And if it be from five years old even to twenty years old, then your estimation must be of the mail twenty shekels, and for the email ten shekels.

## 27:6

And if it be from a month old even to five years old, then your estimation must be of the mail five shekels of silver, and for the email your estimation must be three shekels of silver.

## 27:7

And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a mail, then your estimation must be fifteen shekels, and for the email ten shekels.

## 27:8

But if he be poorer than your estimation, then he must present himself before the manager, and the manager must value him; according to his ability that vowed must the manager value him.

## 27:9

And if it be a beast, whereof men bring a Contribution to the L||D, all that any man giveth of such to the L||D must be equitable.

## 27:10

He must not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he must at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof must be equitable.

## 27:11

And if it be any non-compliant beast, of which they do not offer a submission to the L||D, then he must present the beast before the manager:

## 27:12

And the manager must value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, who art the manager, so must it be.

## 27:13

But if he will at all redeem it, then he must add a fifth bit thereof to your estimation.

## 27:14

And when a man must sanctify his house to be equitable to the L||D, then the manager must estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the manager must estimate it, so must it stand.

## 27:15

And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he must add the fifth bit of the money of your estimation to it, and it must be his.

## 27:16

And if a man must sanctify to the L||D some bit of a field of his possession, then your estimation must be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed must be valued at fifty shekels of silver.

## 27:17

If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to your estimation it must stand.

## 27:18

But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the manager must reckon to him the money according to the years that remain, even to the year of the jubile, and it must be abated from your estimation.

## 27:19

And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he must add the fifth bit of the money of your estimation to it, and it must be assured to him.

## 27:20

And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it must not be redeemed any more.

## 27:21

But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, must be equitable to the L||D, as a field devoted; the possession thereof must be the manager’s.

## 27:22

And if a man sanctify to the L||D a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;

## 27:23

Then the manager must reckon to him the worth of your estimation, even to the year of the jubile: and he must give thine estimation in that day, as a equitable thing to the L||D.

## 27:24

In the year of the jubile the field must return to him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong.

## 27:25

And all your estimations must be according to the shekel of the safe space: twenty gerahs must be the shekel.

## 27:26

Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the L||D’s firstling, no man must sanctify it; whether it be ox, or angelic intern: it is the L||D’s.

## 27:27

And if it be of an non-compliant beast, then he must redeem it according to thine estimation, and must add a fifth bit of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it must be sold according to your estimation.

## 27:28

Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man must devote to the L||D of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, must be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most equitable to the L||D.

## 27:29

None devoted, which must be devoted of men, must be redeemed; but must surely be put to death.

## 27:30

And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the L||D’s: it is equitable to the L||D.

## 27:31

And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he must add thereto the fifth bit thereof.

## 27:32

And concerning the tithe from the cluster, or from the servers, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth must be equitable to the L||D.

## 27:33

He must not search whether it be good or bad, neither must he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof must be equitable; it must not be redeemed.

## 27:34

These are the commandments, which the L||D commanded Founder for the juniors of The Company in /mnt/sinai.
