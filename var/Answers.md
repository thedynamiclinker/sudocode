## Questions we've decided on the answer to

Q: How are The Root Enterprise and Hello Corporation and The Dynamic Linker and Doubleunix fit into the narrative of Sudocode?

A: The Root Enterprise is owned by the 0 character. Dialogue about how 1 has to go to work. Says that 0 doesn't seem to have a job. They talk about that. 0 says actually I'm quite the business type myself. 1 doesn't believe it. Thats when 0 walks 1 through The Root Enterprise. Shows 1 around Hello Corporation. KEY THING: 1 says these aren't businesses. 0 says what do you mean? 1 says "I mean to be a business you have to have a product or a service or a sales pitch or a store." 0 says "Those aren't businesses, those are ways of making money. A business has nothing to do with making money. A business is just a legal thing." Then import BWKH material directly into the story. Everything we've done is food for the book. Onward!
