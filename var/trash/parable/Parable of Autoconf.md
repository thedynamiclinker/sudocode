Type: [[Legacy]], [[System]], [[Creation]], [[Parable]]

---

- How does good code become "legacy code"?
- What vices does code accumulate that makes us call it "legacy"?
- What virtues must "legacy code" possess to make us keep using it?
- How can we tell what wisdom is contained in a legacy codebase, and which of the decisions they made along the way were reasonable?

- Run through the Linux from Scratch project, and you'll see a shocking number of low-level open source projects use the same configuration and build system.
- That system is something called the GNU autotools.
- To a first approximation, the autotools are used by every project in the universe (bash, zsh, cpython, git, coreutils, etc.)

- The autotools are a GNU era artefact, from the 80s-90s during the height of the free software foundation's influence. The era when python and linux were born.
- The autotools are widely recognized as being [crufty as hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Autoconf-automake-process.svg "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:autoconf-automake-process.svg")Â

- The autotools are implemented using something called m4, an ancient macro processor that is almost certainly installed on your machine right now, and which you've almost certainly never used directly.
- And m4 was written by Kernighan and Ritchie, authors of The C Programming Language, the first book to ever have a "Hello, world" in it.

- Ask yourself how the following state is possible:
	- No one loves the autotools.
	- Everyone uses the autotools.
	- Almost no one wants to re-implement whatever it is that the autotools do, even in open source where our culture is to have a near infinite number of reimplementations of any given part of the stack.

Why are the autotools still around, and why do they look the way they do?

Spend an hour trying to reimplement them, and you'll understand why.
