Type: [[Principle]], [[That]], [[Verb]], [[Should]], [[Not]], [[Know]], [[Where]], [[You]], [[Do]], [[Verb]]

- Functions are verbs.
- Where they happen is a preposition.
- Verbs should not attempt to hard-code the place they will happen.
- IO is about where things come from and where they go.
- The i in io means "where data comes from" - this isn't a normal function input.
- The o in io means "where data goes to" - this isn't a normal function output.
- Try to decouple your functions from assumptions about where data came from.
