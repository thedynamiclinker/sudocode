α: Algebra

β: (Not polite to call a group "the betas").

γ: Geometry

δ: Calculus

ε: Analysis

ζ: Number theory (not just numbers). Named for Riemann Zeta function.

η: The Catedral. The "Naturals." Category Theory. Completely incomprehensible. MacLane said we didn't invent category theory to study categories or functors, but natural transformations. Natural transformations are commonly denoted by η. Hence the name. 

θ: Topology. The name is a bit of a racist joke since their field is known not to preserve angles. Also includes the Topos people due to cross pollination from the ηs.

ι: The IO tās. Hardware people. Focused on making things small. "Not one iota."

κ: Not sure this should be the K people. Need to fit business people somewhere. They don't quite fit here though. The letter K comes from Proto Sinaitic hand. Maybe these are the hands on / hardware people?

λ: Descendants of Church. McCarthy, Curry, Howard, Milner, ML, SPJ, Wadler, Haskell, eventually Lean.

μ: Descendants of Godel & Turing. Machines, Moore's Law, practical computing, von Neumann architecture, eventually Unix, C, Python, and everything that runs the modern world.

ν: Artificial Intelligence. Cousin of λ & μ. Alternately neglected and overhyped. Subject to "winters." Appears in booms and busts, not due to the nature of the discipline, but due to the popular appeal of the idea which attracts non-technicals who are interested in anything new. Hence nu.

νega: Fictional Greek letter. Finance people. Not mathematics or computing.

β: The business school of languages is placed here, due to the similarity of pronunciation (the v phoneme) to the nonexistent letter vega, and also due to the proximity to finance, and the business/entrepreneurial class's preference for volatility, which is denoted by vega.

Ξ: Nobody knows what this is. Variously called the Xi, 11, 3, 三, and San. Appears to use all of Unicode. Found in the /boot directory and in kernel space.

ο: The omicrons. Security, cryptography, steganography, encode messages in sequences of o & ο.

Ο: The big O-microns. Complexity theory people. Algorithms books. Adjacent to big Pi. Part of the orthodocs.

Π: The Pis. Computability theory people. Part of the orthodocs. Kleene Mostowski usage motivates the Pi.

Ϻ: San. Deprecated.

Ϙ: Qoppa. Deprecated.

ρ: "The Rows." Relational variant of the rectangle pseudo-culture. 

Σσ: Reverse Mathematics. Stephen Simpson. Also users of Kleene Mostowski. Everything is Σ separation or Σ comprehension. Largely unnoticed by its peers due to where it's sitting.

τ: General Relativity. Tau stands for proper time.

υ: Scientific computing? U for University. Sitting squarely near physics and statistics part of the alphabet. This eventually becomes data science.

φ: Physics

χ: Statistics and probability people.

ψ: Quantum Mechanics

ω: Set Theory, Model theory, Proof theory. Descended from Cantor and Gödel. ZFC and NBG live here. Culturally part of the Orthodocs. Was believed to be the foundations of mathematics for over a century, until recently losing ground to the lambdas.

Ω: Large Cardinals people. The most unhinged subculture. Somehow ended up in "foundations of mathematics." Ingests heroic doses daily. Part of the orthodocs.
