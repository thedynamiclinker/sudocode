- BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE: Sit down, drink some water, and just start writing the "We are the foundational people" dialogue. This is how the foundations book becomes sudocode and gets written.

- Now that we've got a draft of `root/bin/sh`, 0 should make a point to add a new principle "Finish Hello World." We've established that 0 was working on something and he lost it before 1 arrived. We've also established that 0 is going to recover this document by explaining it to 1. So 0 makes a point to 1 that we've already made some progress: the first step for 1 was also the first step for 0. So together, they add a principle to somewhere in the filesystem, probably `/etc/principles/00-finish-hello-world`.

- Find the old heavily noted Linus talk. There definitely used to be more than this.

- Add Phil Wadler directory.

- Add a constructivism directory with some talks by Andrej Bauer.

- Format Escaping the Ivory Tower.

- Make the book markdown standard compliant. This may take some work, but it'll be worth it. We need to be able to display the exact text of the core book on lots of different platforms.
