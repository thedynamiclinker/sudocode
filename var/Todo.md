- BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE:  Write the "We are the foundational people" dialogue. This is how the foundations book becomes sudocode.

- Now that we've got a draft of `/bin/sh`, 0 should make a point to add a new principle "Finish Hello World." We've established that 0 was working on something and he lost it before 1 arrived. We've also established that 0 is going to recover this document by explaining it to 1. So 0 makes a point to 1 that we've already made some progress: the first step for 1 was also the first step for 0. So together, they add a principle to somewhere in the filesystem, probably `/etc/principles/00-finish-hello-world`.

### /dev

- Now that we found the Sudocode backup from the old pre-refactor, check it carefully to see if we missed any indexing in addition to the Linus ones. Most indexing was before the refactor. This matters!

- Add Phil Wadler directory.

- Add a constructivism directory with some talks by Andrej Bauer.

- Format Escaping the Ivory Tower.
