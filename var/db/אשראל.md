My Struggle

By YHWH

===========

Now some people have claimed the title of this book is essentially "mom and dad."

Let me dispel that myth before we get started.

Let's define our terms.

===========

אֲשֵׁרָה: Asherah. First wife. Or mom. It's complicated. Don't read too much into it. This isn't about her.

אל: El. Sometimes Il. Semantics being: Ab in semitic. Ba in chinese. Same thing either way. I don't like to say the word. This isn't about him. Or her. This book is about me. Can we do two title pages? Am I gonna be that kind of author? Ye. Shua. Fukkot. I am. Here goes.

My Struggle

By YHWH
(I Exist)

===========

Hello everyone out there using semitix.

I’m doing a (free) אשרהתing system (just a hobby, won’t be big and professional like 𐎜𐎂𐎗𐎚) for 386(486) את clones. This has been brewing since 𐎊𐎗𐎈 𐎀𐎁, and is starting to get ready. I’d like any feedback on things people like/dislike in semitix, as my אשרהתing system resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the פְּלִשְׁתִּים (due to practical reasons) among other things).

-יהוה

PS. Yes  - it’s free of any semitix code, and it has a multi-threaded פְּשְׁ. It is NOT protable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never will support anything other than יהודים, as that’s all I have :-(.
