Introduction
============

Now some people have claimed the title of this book is essentially "mom and dad."

Let me dispel that myth before we get started.

Let's define our terms.

---

אֲשֵׁרָה: Asherah. First wife. Or mom. It's complicated. Don't read too much into it. This isn't about her.

אל: El. Sometimes Il. Semantics being: Ab in semitic. Ba in chinese. Same thing either way. I don't like to say the word. This isn't about him. Or her. This book is about me.

---

So, back to me.

TODO: add more later

Can we do two title pages? Am I gonna be that kind of author? Ye. Shua. Fukkot. I am. Here goes.

Ok so, right out of the gate, the Authors are up to something in this book.

In the first sentence, the Authors use some extremely weird grammar that suggests that stuff already existed before this, and the god character is just sort of like, organizing it.

> 1 In the beginning of God’s creating of the skies and the earth
> when the earth had been shapeless and formless

Further, the word isn't "god", it's "gods".

The word is אֱלֹהִ֑ים.

That's plural.

People say it's not plural, but it is.

Ok so back to the god character.

Everything is dark.

> 2 and darkness was on the face of the deep,
> and God’s spirit was hovering on the face of the water

So the god character makes light.

> 3 And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.

Then the book is like "And he saw it."

Because obviously, once there's light, you can see stuff.

> 4 And God saw the light, that it was good,

But the light isn't just light light, it's got a bunch of dark light mixed in with it, so then god has to like, clean the light, by getting all the dark bits out of it.

> and God separated between the light and the darkness.

So then as soon as he segregates the light light from the dark light, days get invented.

> 5 And God called the light "day" and called the darkness "night." And there was evening, and there was morning: one day.

And then immediately after inventing days and nights, bam, it's day two. So this god character seems to be getting affected by the stuff he's doing.

Ok so day two.

> 6 And God said, “Let there be a space within the water, and let it separate between water and water.”

The god character thinks the sky is blue because there's water up there, which is totally reasonable because otherwise where would rain come from?

Obviously the fact that rain exists means there's "up water" too, not just "down water" down in the oceans and stuff.

So to create land, you have to separate the "up water" from the "down water." So that's what we do next.

> 7 And God made the space, and it separated between the water that was under the space and the water that was above the space. And it was so.

> 8 And God called the space “skies.” And there was evening, and there was morning: a second day.

Ok so there's now up water and down water, but no middle water. So to create land, you have to sweep some of the down water away into a separate spot because if it's everywhere then there's no land. So now let's do that.

> 9 And God said, “Let the waters be concentrated under the skies into one place, and let the land appear.” And it was so.

> 10 And God called the land “earth,” and called the concentration of the waters “seas.” And God saw that it was good.

Now we do plants and stuff.

> 11 And God said, “Let the earth generate plants, vegetation that produces seed, fruit trees, each making fruit of its own kind, which has its seed in it, on the earth. And it was so:

> 12 The earth brought out plants, vegetation that produces seeds of its own kind, and trees that make fruit that each has seeds of its own kind in it. And God saw that it was good.

> 13 And there was evening, and there was morning: a third day.

Ok so at this point, the god character realizes that it's equally bright during day and night. I mean all we did so far is distinguish the dark light from the light light and put them in different places. They keep alternating but it's not clear why yet. So now the god character sort of retcons a reason for that, by inventing two sky balls to distinguish between day and night. The sky balls might also be useful for holidays, thinks the god character.

> 14 And God said, Let there be lights in the space of the skies to distinguish between the day and the night, and they will be for signs and for appointed times and for days and years.

> 15 And they will be for lights in the space of the skies to shed light on the earth. And it was so.

Also the moon is in charge of the stars.

> 16 And God made the two big lights - the bigger light for the regulation of the day and the smaller light for the regulation of the night - and the stars.

> 17 And God set them in the space of the skies to shed light on the earth

> 18 and to regulate the day and the night and to distinguish between the light and the darkness. And God saw that it was good.

> 19 And there was evening, and there was morning: a fourth day.

Then the god character realizes that those holidays aren't gonna celebrate themselves, so we're gonna need some people, and before that we're gonna need something for them to eat during the holidays. So now we do animals.

> 20 And God said, "Let the water swarm with a swarm of living beings, and let birds fly over the earth on the face of the space of the skies."

> 21 And God created the big sea serpents and all the living beings that creep, with which the water swarmed, by their kinds, and every winged bird by its kind. And God saw that it was good.

1. Fish: check.
2. Birds: check.
3. Sea serpents: check.

Now get to fucking, says god. The god character loves fucking. He's all about making the things he made make more of the things he made. By the time we get to Abraham, it's practically an obsession.

> 22 And God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds multiply in the earth.”

> 23 And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.

Then he makes domestic animals.

> 24 And God said, “Let the earth bring out living beings by their kind, domestic animal and creeping thing and wild animals of the earth by their kind.” And it was so.

> 25 And God made the wild animals of the earth by their kind and the domestic animals by their kind and every creeping thing of the ground by their kind. And God saw that it was good.

These sentences all seem to be happening twice.

It's almost like there's more than one of this guy.

> 26 And God said, “Let us make a human, in our image, according to our likeness, and let them dominate the fish of the sea and the birds of the skies and the domestic animals and all the earth and all the creeping things that creep on the earth.”

That "us" is actually plural. Here's Richard Elliot Friedman's footnote from Commentary on the Torah.

> 1:26. **Let us make.** Why does God speak in the plural here? Some take the plural to be “the royal we” as used by royalty and the papacy among humans, but this alone does not account for the fact that it occurs only in the opening chapters of the Torah and nowhere else. Others take the plural to mean that God is addressing a heavenly court of angels, seraphim, or other heavenly creatures, although this, too, does not explain the limitation of the phenomenon to the opening chapters. More plausible, though by no means certain, is the suggestion that it is an Israelite, monotheistic reflection of the pagan language of the divine council. In pagan myth, the chief god, when formally speaking for the council of the gods, speaks in the plural. Such language might be appropriate for the opening chapters of the Torah, thus asserting that the God of Israel has taken over this role.

Also remember the word "god" here is still אֱלֹהִ֑ים, "Elohim", which is gramatically plural, though the standard explanation is "No it isn't."

> [!NOTE] Elohim
> 
> Elohim (Hebrew: אֱלֹהִים, romanized: ʾĔlōhīm \[(ʔ)eloˈ(h)im\]) is a Hebrew word meaning "gods" or "godhood". Although the word is plural in form, in the Hebrew Bible it most often takes singular verbal or pronominal agreement and refers to a single deity, particularly but not always the God of Judaism. In other verses it takes plural agreement and refers to gods in the plural.
>
> Morphologically, the word is the plural form of the word אֱלוֹהַּ (ʾĔlōah) and related to [El](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_(deity)). It is cognate to the word ʾl-h-m which is found in Ugaritic, where it is used as the pantheon for Canaanite gods, the children of El, and conventionally vocalized as "Elohim".

```
וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים נַעֲשֶׂה אָדָם בְּצַלְמֵנוּ כִּדְמוּתֵנוּ
And God(s) said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness
```

Now the next sentence is basically the same as the previous one, but this time it's singular.

> 27 And God created the human in His image. He created it in the image of God; He created them male and female.

Ok now god creates humans, tells them to make more humans, and also to domesticate those domestic animals he made earlier.

> 28 And God blessed them, and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and dominate the fish of the sea and the birds of the skies and every animal that creeps on the earth."

Oh and the plants too. Eat those.

> 29 And God said, “Here, I have placed all the vegetation that produces seed that is on the face of all the earth for you and every tree, which has in it the fruit of a tree producing seed. It will be food for you.

Everything is food. You can eat anything.

> 30 and for all the wild animals of the earth and for all the birds of the skies and for all the creeping things on the earth, everything in which there is a living being: every plant of vegetation, for food.” And it was so.

> 31 And God saw everything that He had made, and, here, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.

Speaking of the whole "seeing that it's good" thing, here's when that happens.

| Day | How many times he checks if it's good |
| --- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Once                                  |
| 2   | Zero                                  |
| 3   | Twice                                 |
| 4   | Once                                  |
| 5   | Once                                  |
| 6   | Once                                  |

This god character has a thing he does every day.

But one day he seems to forget, and then he does it twice the next day.

It feels like The Authors are up to something. Something they aren't entirely saying openly.

That's the beauty of this book. As we'll see later, this book has a habit of saying the same thing over and over a thousand times, but never saying it explicitly. It's as if the entire thing is written in innuendo. We haven't seen enough examples of that yet to be convincing, but give it time.

For now, back to the god character.

He decides that's enough work for one week, and we're off to chapter two.

Hello everyone out there using semitix.

I’m doing a (free) אשרהתing system (just a hobby, won’t be big and professional like 𐎜𐎂𐎗𐎚) for 386(486) את clones. This has been brewing since 𐎊𐎗𐎈 𐎀𐎁, and is starting to get ready. I’d like any feedback on things people like/dislike in semitix, as my אשרהתing system resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the פְּלִשְׁתִּים (due to practical reasons) among other things).

-יהוה

PS. Yes  - it’s free of any semitix code, and it has a multi-threaded פְּשְׁ. It is NOT protable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never will support anything other than יהודים, as that’s all I have :-(.
