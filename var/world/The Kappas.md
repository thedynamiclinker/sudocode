It is believed the name "The Kappas" is derived from a slur used by other /etc/groups to describe this group. The slur derives from the [K Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_(programming_language)), an extreme example of this culture that is not widely known within it.

The name used by the group to describe itself remains unknown, as this fact was likely stored in a comment rather than a variable name, or perhaps in the name of a macro that was lost at compile time.

Often called The Rectangle People by other /etc/groups.

They seem to believe themselves to be "mathematicians" of some sort, though their verbiage, values, and behaviors suggest they're most likely a mixture of numerical analysts and former physics graduate students.

A strange and primitive culture.
