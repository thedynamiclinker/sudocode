It is believed the name "The Kappas" is derived from a slur used by other /etc/groups to describe this group. The slur derives from the [K Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_(programming_language)), an extreme example of this culture that is not widely known within it.

The name used by the group to describe itself remains unknown, as this fact was likely stored in an integer index used as an offset into a large rectangular array, rather than being stored in a symbolic variable name.

Often called The Rectangle People by other /etc/groups.

They seem to believe themselves to be "mathematicians" of some sort, though their verbiage, values, and behaviors suggest they're most likely a mixture of numerical analysts and former physics graduate students.

A strange and primitive culture.
