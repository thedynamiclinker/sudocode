As far as I can tell, the first mention of it is this:

> B. Russell, “Letter to the Editor,” _Revue de Métaphysique et de Morale_ 14 (March 1903), p. 153.

| **16 June 1902** | Private letter to Frege                              | “I have found a contradiction…” (no name)                   |
| **March 1903**   | _Revue de Métaphysique et de Morale_ letter          | “a certain contradiction”                                   |

| **1908**         | _Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types_ | Retrospectively called “the contradiction discovered by me” |
| **Post-1908**    | Literature (Zermelo, Poincaré, etc.)                 | The phrase **“Russell’s paradox”** becomes standard         |
