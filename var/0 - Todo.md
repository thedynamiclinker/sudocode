### Queue

Files currently in "notes" format, with anti-gist images, ready to be written at any time.

- [ ] staging: /var/log/ic
- [ ] staging: kleene

### Snippets

Put this in queued files.

- NOTE
- This is a very bare bones skeleton of what eventually needs to go here.
- This file is closer to a set of notes than it is to a rough draft.
- If you're not one of the Authors of this book, ignore this file.

### TODO

- [x] Phone pull.
- [x] Clean all emails.
- [x] Delete phone pics.
- [x] Toss irrelevant stuff onto external hard drive.
- [x] Put all the Church pictures in And He Called and write the dialogue around it.
- [x] Find the images of the section in Hirst book where he says Kleene has a "Frighteningly technical bent." Include this in the Church section anywhere.
- [x] Take more pictures of all the places in "An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory" where he says "Kleene Kleene Kleene," then mention Kleene.

- [ ] Finish the Church dialogue.
- [ ] Gödel section: Show the definitions of primitive recursive and recursive from Meldelson, then show the definition of Gödel numbering, then work through the first of the /opt/art examples in detail to show what it meant.
- [ ] Turing section: Include first page of Kleene's chapter on Computable functions.
- [ ] Kleene ties them all together: Screenshots of the Church's Thesis section of Introduction to Metamathematics.
- [ ] Also mention that Kleene invented regexes in a paper about neural networks and Ken cites him.
- [ ] Write a bare-bones skeleton version of the `/var/log/ic` dialogue on the history of logic notation, put this after the Foundational People man page but before the We dialogues. It's 0 showing 1 what it would look like to NOT have a creation story.
- [ ] In /opt/art, explain the spectrum from Art History Textbook to Guided Tour of a Museum. Different sections of the book need to be able to choose where they fall along that spectrum. The anti-gist is the guided tour. We'll be doing it a lot as we cover the early days of the field. After all, this isn't a book about history. "I'm not convinced." Fair point. It's a bible. Bibles are fiction-nonfiction, they're history, they're practical principles, they're pre-modern and post-modern libraries full of genre transitions and an intense amount of detail that can make the whole thing a bit jarring to read. And they're without a doubt the most viral memes of all time.
- [ ] Get to the `/etc/group` dialogue.
- [ ] Clean this file!

### Somewhere
- Contact Chet Ramey, explain that you've found a bug, and would like to include it in a book. The book is called "sudo code", and it's a series of technical dialogues between two characters, 0 and 1.
- Show Bill Joy's vi keyboard with the arrows on the letter keys. A lot of stuff in life that never makes sense unless you know how the original authors wrote. 
- The man dialogue: 0 shows 1 the first edition Unix man pages.
- Add a /dev/constructive directory with some talks by Andrej Bauer.

### Prehistory

- Curry Howard in all its forms is the foundation of the justification that the history of programming connects back through the history of logic and foundations.
- That gives a clear justification for exploration of the non-standard logics in Graham Priest's book.

### Do a dump of principles either after returning from /mnt/sinai or after completing the mini-torah in lost+found/We
- First one is the commandment dump.
- Second one is the "second law" dump.

Possible principles:
- Metacommentary solves everything.
    - Author's Note: Somehow this principle is the hardest to explain, despite being one of the most important, not to mention one of the easiest to apply in practice. Todo before publishing the book: Find a way to explain this principle. Or, lacking that, give an example. Or, lacking that, just leave this text here and publish as is. After all, metacommentary solves everything.
- Learn who you admire 
    - To create a curriculum for yourself in any field, first learn who you admire, then learn _from_ who you admire. Once you have a critical mass of heroes, you'll begin to see patterns in their behavior that you should them attempt to systematize and distill into principles. This ritual allows you to synthesize an ideal teacher for your particular values, preferences, and learning style.
- To learn, teach
    - So far in our story, it's not clear if the 1 character has learned much. However, the 0 character has learned a lot by attempting to teach 1. In the remainder of the book, 0 will teach 1 by asking 1 to teach 0.

### The incomplete story of incompleteness
- Definitely need to mention the rarely discussed side effect of the incompleteness theorems: If mathematics is more limited than we thought, suddenly it becomes a lot more plausible to define "computation." Even the space of "all possible computations" is potentially within the reach of a formal definition. Though many of the main players involved in the early theory of "effective calculability" didn't expect that they were capturing all possible computations in their definitions, it's probably not an accident that all 3 of our definitions of "computable" appeared within 5 years of Gödel's incompleteness theorems. In the years from 1900 to 1931, it simply didn't feel plausible to give a definition that might hope to capture all possible computations. In a very real sense, we may owe the origins of modern computing to the discovery of incompleteness.

### Getting root

- Add more of the images now in `/var/include/learn-the-alphabet` to the `/mnt/sinai` dream sequence, or set them aside to be used in other files of a similar nature. 

### For Ancient Unix
- Song of the C
- Dead C Scrolls (maybe the recovered PDP-7 sources?)

### Turing
- Somehow work in the sex footnote in 1937 paper.


![[turing-1937-sex-footnote-1.png]]

![[turing-1937-sex-footnote-2.png]]


- Kleene: First programmer. First standard library. First critical vulnerability (λ calculus inconsistency). First to have contact with all three of the above and to demonstrate their equivalence. First to clean up and popularize the ideas in Introduction to Metamathematics.
- Kleeneliness is next to Godeliness.
- After /dev/zero, we need a begat list to take us to Unix.
- Kleene invented regexes.
- Ken Thompson cites Kleene and says we assume you're familiar.
- Church received an honorary Doctor of Science degrees from Case Western Reserve University in 1969!
- Email as prayer

### ASAP, put the quote from /dev/zero/Computability and Problems with Set Theory somewhere
- These axioms are the official doctrine - Remarkably, this is not just the official doctrine for set theory, it turns out that this is the official doctrine for mathematics! - Very few people seem to have a problem with that which I find quite remarkable.
- There are some other quotes.

### 0 & 1 eventually agree on the requirements for a proper bible
- Beginning of time
- End of time
- G\*d / El (Gödel)
- Church (Alonzo)
- Martyr (Turing)
- Song of the Sea (Quoth the Meme)
- Commandments (The principles)
- Old & New (Unix & Linux)
- An Egypt with Hieroglyphs (Multics)
- A Jews with Proto Sinaitic (Unix)
- An Abraham: Prolific patriarch who seemed at first to be disorganized and not really have his shit together but who turned out to be the person who basically everything descends from, with descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky (Ken)
- A series of books named after people we admire (The /dev directory)
- Proverbs (Should be in /dev/random.)
- Psalms. (The Psalms directory.)
- Parables (The stories about each command: cat, grep as s, make, man/roff as "a lie", utf8 created on a napkin.)

### We
- During ld.so when the conversation moves into `/opt/art`, that should really be in `the-second-law` or something linked to it.
- Move this content later, so that we can more quickly get to the three members of the trinity, or what we'll call `/dev/zero`

### /boot
- The /boot dialogues were good, especially the bit with the binary loader we wrote in C.
- Need to find somewhere to put this, because it doesn't quite belong anywhere in the narrative yet.

### /usr/src/bash

We've got a bug in bash upstream related to "history" that's also somehow about being inside case. The fact that most people don't know bash is maintained by one guy is a different kind bug in our history, and it's also related to being inside case (Chet is at Case western reserve university.) Reach out to Chet, make him a character, have a dialogue where he helps 0 and 1 fix the bug, and make a who's-on-first style dialogue with the history history case case stuff above.

### /opt/art

Need to explain eventually that:
- The art means "arithmetic run time."
- To be explained once we get to the man dialogue and see brt1 and brt2 in early Unix.
- Need to explain crt1.o, crti.o, crtn.o too.
- The crt files live in /lib. The brt files lived in /etc. No one seems to know where to put these, so the "a" files go in /opt.
- Much like crt gets linked into every C program, formal Arithmetic (and incompleteness) gets linked into any formal system strong enough to express Arithmetic.


![[man-001.png]]


### /use/share/dict

#### The ⟂-docs
Pronounced "Orthodox." The orthogonal documents. Refers to theoretical computer science, primary computability and complexity as elaborated in the decades since the lambdas and the mus split. Though it appears on the surface to be the same culture, it is mostly orthogonal to the history of our people.

#### antigist
1: What was the point of showing me all that code I didn't understand back in /opt/art? And why was it in a file calle---

0: Antigist.

1: What?

0: That's why I showed you. It's important in our field to give the Antigist of things whenever possible.

1: The... an---

0: Antigist. Exactly.

1: Is that like the opposite of Tigist?

0: What? No. Why would it be that?

1: You know, like anaerobic, anemia, anarchy. The "an" means "opposite."

0: ...Not here.

1: So it's not the opposite of Tigist?

0: What's Tigist?

1: I dunno.

0: Anti-gist.

1: Oh!

0: The opposite of gist.

1: Why would that be a good thing?

0: Are you kidding? It's a great thing! Especially important in our field. 

1: But wait, "gist" is like... the only part you need to understand, right?

0: Absolutely not.

1: You don't like the "gist" of things?

0: I never said that. I love "gist." The gist of things is usually the most important part.

1: I'm so confused. Isn't that what I said?

0: Not even a little.

1: Explain?


### babel


At this point, having emphasized the Optimize for Sharing principle, we begin the babel puzzle.

- Change hostname to world.
- And the whole world was of one language, and of one speech.
- What language?
- Machine language.
- How is that one language? There are plenty of different instruction sets.
- I said the world not the universe.
- (Show prompt)
- See?
- Oh.
- Language boundaries are a fiction. To the machine, they're all the same. Simply learn to use LD - the linker - and nothing we imagine will be impossible. We can build a stack to the heavens. Through LD, all things are possible.
- Never thought of it that way. I don't know much about LD. Teach me!
- Babel puzzle starts here.
- The first LD is the linker. The thing that offered the power to make all languages become one, but scattered the languages of the earth and reminded our people to remain humble.
- Humility leads to the other LD: ld.so. Code sharing through exec, for which ld.so is responsible, and this eventually leads to Unix and pipes.
- Two LDs, one is the elder LD from the babel story, the other is the Second Order LD, the loader, that performs a similar function to the elder LD at runtime, but does so to support a more humble and powerful method of code sharing: exec.

- Once we get exec, the babel puzzle is complete. We immediately start Genesis 12, which is a long begat list that leads to Abraham (aka Ken.)


### bbl1.o, bbli.o, bbln.o

TODO:
- Continue where the babel dialogue left off, explaining the "git blame" below and how the bible is more like a code base than any other genre.
- Mention that the boring parts are mostly by the bureaucrat (priestly source.) Same as codebases.
- Then at the end of this file, have 1 say this is fun and all, but I came here to study programming, not bibles.
- Use this to transition to bbli.o, aka "biblio" aka "bibliography" aka "previous research in computing bibles." In that file we cover PoC || GTFO.
- After bbli.o, do bbln.o, which explains what we won't be doing. In that file, cover "The Linux Bible," and also say we won't be doing a slavish repetition like for example: Then say "We won't be starting with hello world, and then saying something like The Python was the cleverest of all the creatures, humans acquired knowledge of best practices, this knowledge sentenced them to mortality. Soon after, two sons, Simplicity and Complexity. Complexity kills Simplicity, etc. Then we definitely won't be saying Ok what comes next and finding an excuse to insert something about Babel, and then putting in a begat list that takes us from Babel to Abraham, who is of course the ancestor of our people whose descendants are as numerous as stars in the sky, which is naturally Ken Thompson, then---"
- 1 says "That sounds like 80% of what we've been doing. Plus the new bits about best practices."
- 1 says "Look this is nice and all but I'd really prefer a true history."
- 0 says "Define true."
- 1 says "Like what actually happened? How was our field actually created? Obviously this stuff about the snake is a parable or something. And saying that complexity killed simplicity doesn't really teach me anything I didn't already know. Plus it's not true."
- Then switch to /bin/whoami and the history of computing from the early days of foundations and Church/Godel/Turing.

### visit databases as a location of a file system and be like this is a f****** abomination 


## Questions

- Q: Where do the principles go?

- Q: How do The Root Enterprise and Hello Corporation and The Dynamic Linker and Doubleunix fit into the narrative? We've got a good start with the BWKH linkage but we need to flesh out the world more in a way that allows us to abstract our actual human selves out of it. Although 0 could just say that the two humans aren't important, they're working for him.

## Questions With Answers

Q: How are The Root Enterprise and Hello Corporation and The Dynamic Linker and Doubleunix fit into the narrative of Sudocode?

A: The Root Enterprise is owned by the 0 character. Dialogue about how 1 has to go to work. Says that 0 doesn't seem to have a job. They talk about that. 0 says actually I'm quite the business type myself. 1 doesn't believe it. Thats when 0 walks 1 through The Root Enterprise. Shows 1 around Hello Corporation. KEY THING: 1 says these aren't businesses. 0 says what do you mean? 1 says "I mean to be a business you have to have a product or a service or a sales pitch or a store." 0 says "Those aren't businesses, those are ways of making money. A business has nothing to do with making money. A business is just a legal thing." Then import BWKH material directly into the story. Everything we've done is food for the book. Onward!

---

Q: Where do different threads go? Like a set of different dialogues that have a common theme but aren't adjacent. Maybe we just have the kernel gods link them into process groups inside of `/proc`?

A: Organize it like Unix. The threads aren't localized any more than all the files that belong to cowsay are localized. They're everywhere, according to the FHS. The system is sliced orthogonally to package isolation. Don't be Mac and try to statically link shit. Be everywhere. It's Unix. Then toward the end we find harmony with the other approach (code sharing + localization) via snow (aka nix).

---

Q: Where does the bulk of the narrative go? We can't be jumping around to different directories every single time. Or maybe we can?

A: `/root/bin` or `/root/src` would be good, since that's "sudo code." But 1 is writing in there. Then again, 0 could just chmod it or add user to the root group, though that should be a big event like halfway through. Alternatively, could wait until 1/4 or 1/3 way through, address the fact that 1 can't write in `/root`, then say that 1 hasn't been writing yet, 0's been writing for 1. At that point Ra takes over as a contributor to 1's side of the dialogues and we move the convo into `/home/user/src`. Then when we're halfway through, 0 gives 1 write access to `/root`. That's when we switch from "Part 1: 0" to "Part 2: 1". That feels like a good start.

A2: Wow, we've made so much progress since I wrote the above A. I think this question has been answered.

## Bibles

Occasionally root and user should issue a syscall which traps execution up into the kernel, at which point the Authors should monologue a bit about the data format of bibles and talk about Friedman's research and some basic OTL stuff.

---

Assorted things I removed from the main text:

> [!bible-note] Bible Note:
> Bibles are like that. They have a tendency to switch seamlessly between Authors without saying when they did or who's writing. Just like codebases. You'd be surprised at the similarities. Bibles are more like a codebase than any other type of document. That can make these bible things a bit jarring to read, but it's one of the many things we have to do, in aiming to emulate the deep structure of these objects, not just the surface structure. More on that below.

Not to superficially parrot them (as has been done countless times) by writing unhelpful sentences like "Ken begat Unix, and Unix begat C."

> [!bible] Bible Note:
> The PoC || GTFO volumes on stunt hacking and computing culture are a very good example of how wrapping a volume in surface level bible-ese can make its content more memorable and funny, while at the same time contributing little of lasting value except extra entertainment and good vibes. This sentiment is not shared by all the Authors of the present volume, however, some of whom object to the previous sentence, and would like to state unequivocally: We love PoC || GTFO, long live its many authors, and Godspeed, Travis Goodspeed.


### The 64 Laws

- Model for the book: I didn't originally think of it like this, but this book is essentially the 48 Laws of Power for Computing. It's as broad in its coverage of Computing as 48 Laws is in its. It's similar in that it takes virtually all of its wisdom from "the greats," and cites them heavily. Put Joost Elffers on the list of publishers to contact. We'll also very likely need to commit to being published in color at least in a minimal way, like Robert Greene's books. Greene was 39 when the 48 Laws was published. I'll be 39 next year. It was his first book. I've published a book before with Basic Books, and it was translated into 6 languages. I'd propose that it's not unrealistic for us to achieve similar levels of acclaim for technical writing that Greene's books have for human nature.

- Robert Greene's 48 Laws are on average 42 characters long. That's a good length. We may be able to get to 32. Update: We're currently at 27.2. Keep this up!

### The 64 Bits

- The 64 Principles. The 32 Values. (May be only 16 or even 8. Determine empirically.)

- If you shoot for exactly 64 principles, you can use single 64 but ints as vectors to encode the relevance of arbitrary pieces of content to every single section of the book. We're absolutely doing this.

- NOTE: If we do "32 Principles, 32 Values" or "32 Principles, 16 Values, 16 Anti-Values" then we can get WAY more representational power out of each 64 bit int.

- The entire book should be representable as 64 bits\*64 ints of information, aka 512 bytes. In other words, this book can literally be dd'ed to a boot sector.

- STRETCH GOAL: Make it fucking bootable. Should be possible (maybe) by reordering things, but probably not on x86 without some domas magic, and then it wouldn't be the book, but still, do things like this whenever possible.

### The Three Books

- The paper book will be statically linked, without a single url pointing outside of it. It will reference the outside world, but have no concrete pointers to it. Everything will be "in-housed" or "vendored." Links to webpages will be transformed into screenshots and placed in the archaeology section at the back. Videos will be turned into printed quotes (which requires us to limit ourselves to videos that are essentially pointers to human speech, not complicated visual scenes or songs.) This ensures a complete and self contained book. This is the correct approach when the outside world is maximally unstable.

- The digital book will be dynamically linked. Namely, it will reference the outside world using the universal mechanism of our age: the hyperlink, a reference to this universal human blob we call the web. This version will be subject to all the problems that come with it. 

- The  (new world / old world) book will be a video, sense data, audio and video, sights and sounds, instead of the intermediate age technology of the printed word used by the others. It will consist of exactly the same content as the book. Links to videos will be inlined and played so the original speaker's voice and emotional tone is available in ways the other two formats fail to show.

- The (n女ν|Ωld)ω||ld book is a separate and very large Easter Egg with different content. It is possible to "get root" on the book, and in doing so to gain access to kernel space where the gods (the real authors / the Nameless) speak freely in ways that aren't visible in the standard (user space) book.

### The Two Rings

- The book has two models: Kernel Space and User Space. Kernel Space is rarely seen, but it's where the real creators (the Nameless) speak in an interleaved stream of voices without attribution, bible style. User Space is the vast majority of the book. It consists of a linear narrative, in the form of dialogues between two characters: 0 and 1. The book is designed to be two opposite extremes at once, along several dimensions. For example, it intends to be extremely experimental, multi genre, multi site, multi platform, jumping from the obsidian page through to github into videos and then back into the book. Any book that aims to be structured like this is doomed to failure unless it also has a much more conventional way of experiencing the same thing. So it aims to do the latter first, as a constraint on the former. The entire book and all its content must be representable linearly on the page, in printed word, in the form of a conventional book. That same content without additions or deletions will also be represented in more modern media: hypertext, video, source control, pages with a burdensomely large number of external reference links, all optional. We do this not in an attempt to be "modern," but in an attempt to ask what it means to make something truly timeless that represents our age of history, when the media we store our life's work in is now infinitely more fragile than text in physical pages. Data may be easier to copy now by many orders of magnitude. But if a book links to a well-known website or meme and the destination url changes later or the website stops existing, we now no longer have anything left, except maybe archive.org if we're lucky. The "less efficient" medium of physical paper had a benefit we learned to take for granted: that when you burn a book, you do not burn all its copies. This remains true for files people download physically and share over p2p protocols like bittorrent, or even just by reuploading the same content to youtube after its been taken down. The same robustness does not exist for the web. We can no longer stably reference the primary storage medium where most members of our species store the majority of their life's work. The conscious choice for this book to represent precisely the same content, no additions or deletions, in multiple formats, each with the inherent virtues and vices of that format, is part of a theme throughout the book of what it means to be timeless in an age where nothing is.

### The 0o10 Years

- Historically: LD led to Radicalize led to We led to the eclipse and life collapse. Then the slow rebuilding through jobs and the book was put aside. Collapse led to Gyana led to AV and stability for five years, led to Aicadium led to teetering on the edge of oblivion and then finally to LD (the company) after two broken hands. This led to the first passion project in a while: On the Lamb, which was almost too much to share even with anyone who wasn't directly involved in making it. You have to choose to enter that Rabbit Hole when you're ready, it can't be forced. Then On The Lamb led to a calm after finally getting We out of my brain and into something semi permanent. That led to a revisitation of mathematics and education, and after a month, to the decision to focus on the social side of the business. This led to several months of intense focus on the details of how to open physical locations, renting corporate real estate, looking at fifty available sites in person, and and hiring a commercial real estate negotiator for literally $6000 and then doing precisely nothing with him once we realized he's useless and (independently) there are actually too many laws in California to even open something small and everyone cautions against it. This led to the decision to take a weekend trip to Austin and explore the possibility of living somewhere that might be better all around for business, for tech, for raising kids, and for anything we might end up doing. It had to be a Pareto improvement, not just better by some loss function that makes tradeoffs. This led to several months of packing up the old house and deciding to rent it out, becoming landlords, and moving to north Austin, where we now live. This book is about who we are, as developers, about our shared history and culture, about the data structures we call bibles and how our culture is desperately in need of one. A serious one, which is to say an infinite recursive joke that's also dense with timeless truth. It might therefore be surprising that this book has been in progress since before my first job in tech. It's not the same thing it was then, but all the essential elements are the same. Quitting school. Quitting work. Saying Fukkot. A group called LD. Bibles. Legal Latin. Information Theoretic Prose. Comet. The Nth Stair. Cult of the Minor Error. Getting Root. 根2. Gentoo. Root 2. Dudethey'reontome. The News. Genesis: The Middle. Fiddler. A χld named K. Terrorists who don't actually do any terror. When academia dies, where do we go? How all technical writing sucks but it's the one thing the best content still can't replace. The optimal genre as 99% BMC and 1% the ability to slap the reader in real life, and how that final 1% changes the other 99. CDB. ABC. char \*quotations. That of which one cannot speak and yet does. Dynamic Linker as the brain, as a bible, as the only way to make something timeless in an era when all is elsewhere on a fleeting and forever changing web. The Dynamic Read Writable Free Encyclopedic Repository of the Modern State of Human Knowledge. 


### The N Chapters

- Final chapter is obviously called "When theres nothing left to take away."
- I don't know why. I can't justify it. But it feels so unquestionably right.
