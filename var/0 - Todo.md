### The Foundational People

- Once upon a time, a strange culture arose. No one knows who the first members were. But they were clearly different from the others. They were often found in the old institutions, the ones we once called universities. They had no department of their own, and instead took residence in the departments of other cultures.
- They were often found in mathematics departments, though always on the periphery. The mathematicians found them strange, for they showed no particular interest in any of the standard mathematical objects. They dabbled in every area, but settled down in none. Every field of mathematics seemed to interest them equally, though they expressed flatly zero interest in any of it at the research level. Their research questions made no mention of the abstract algebra of groups, rings, and fields, nor did it involve real analysis, functional analysis, real or complex manifolds, topological spaces, vector spaces, number theory, algebraic geometry, graph theory, combinatorics, differential equations, or applications of mathematics to the sciences.
- Instead, this culture's object of study appeared to be something like "languages."
- But they were not linguists, and no one could reasonably confuse the two. They were virtually never found in linguistics departments, for the languages they studied were not spoken by any human group. Even they themselves did not speak the languages they studied.
- They claimed to be minimalists, interested in simplicity perhaps above all other values, and always in search of first principles. But unlike the algebraists, whose "groups" could be described in a simple list of four axioms, this odd culture was rarely seen studying a language with even finitely many axioms. Even the simplest of their languages often required so-called "axiom schemas," a euphemism they used to refer to infinite lists of axioms. It was not clear in what sense this was supposed to be simple, and it did not appear to count as minimalism.
- The closest they came to expressing interest in any standard mathematical topic was their clear interest in "arithmetic". The basic addition and multiplication of natural numbers was one of their primary research topics. But they did not find a home among the number theorists, for they had very few common interests with this ancient mathematical culture. Number theory was always the most mathematical of all mathematical fields. The more one was interested in standard mathematical objects and questions, the more one tended to gravitate toward number theory. Our unusual culture was, if anything, the opposite of that.
- From time to time, members of this culture would be found inhabiting a philosophy department. But there too, they were regarded with suspicion, for they placed no value on making convincing arguments in natural language, preferring instead to write indecipherable hieroglyph like inscriptions in their "languages." When they wrote in natural language, they followed none of the social norms of the philosophers. They did not appear to be concerned with the work of their philosophical colleagues, or with the history of the field, except as a passing curiosity.
- This group is few in number, but it would not be incorrect to say that it runs the modern world. It runs the banks, the media, the big tech companies. Their creations are installed in every household, often with cameras and listening devices attached.
- They are no longer found in mathematics departments as often as they used to be. These days, they are scattered like the stars in the sky, with no one place to call home. Most of the members are not even aware that they belong to this culture. They were never taught its history, and they remain unaware of its stories and of their ancestry.
- Most members of this group now call themselves developers, though not all developers can be said to belong to this people.
- They created the modern world, though they are not usually "machine people."
- They have no name, but their proper name is clear once we understand their history.
- They are not the mathematicians. Nor the philosophers. They're not physicists or statisticians. They're certainly not the electrical engineers, though these two groups were often found together especially in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s.
- This is a book about their culture and history. Because many books have been written in which they feature prominently. But none has yet told them who they are and where they came from.
- We belong to this group.
- It is the bottom of all things. It is the beginning. The fundamentals. It is the bedrock of human knowledge and, these days, human society.
- We are the Foundational People.

### Get the Anti-gist

This needs to be a major theme of the book, starting with the "First code ever written" dialogue. Rewrite most of ld and ld.so, make them brief and more didactic, and call them login or whoami.

### @world

Contact Chet Ramey, explain that you've found a bug, and would like to include it in a book. The book is called "sudo code", and it's a series of technical dialogues between two characters, 0 and 1. The 0 character is a sort of teacher figure, 1 is younger and more in touch with modern side of computing, but less aware of our shared history (Unix, C, GNU, and important things like who Chet Ramey is.)

I'm a former Basic Books author and I've already published a book that was translated into 6 languages by various publishers around the world, so I know enough of the process that I think the project is pretty realistic and within the achievable range given my personal set of skills && flaws, the latter of which is a larger set than the former, but at least I know enough of computing to write a book that might plausibly be something unique.

I'm sure you're busy so I don't want to bother you unnecessarily, but I'm also reasonably confident that you don't have a TON of requests coming in asking if you'd like to be involved in a dialogue with two abstract characters named 0 and 1 about the history of computing, so I feel confident enough to gently nudge you in the direction of saying "Hey Chet, do this."

Hey Chet, do this.


### /lib/ld.so

The "Foundational People" dialogue.

Possibly Cover:
- [L||D](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Names_of_God_in_Judaism#Erasing_the_name_of_God:~:text=The%20words%20God%20and%20Lord%20are%20written%20by%20some%20Jews%20as%20G%2Dd%20and%20L%2Drd%20as%20a%20way%20of%20avoiding%20writing%20any%20name%20of%20God%20out%20in%20full.). Oh are you religious? What no read the link again. "...as a way of avoiding writing any name of God out in full." Why else would you avoid writing out the name of God in full? ...To save keystrokes. To save keystrokes? Why does anyone avoid typing anything in full? Because it's long. This is an ancient principle among our people. Who's our people? Unix. Well, not really. But they're the closest thing to our people's modern representatives. Mention i18n an l10n. Cover no vowels. Cover ld as "dynamic linker" and writing backwards. Cover the logo. 
- Well there's a lot of stuff in life that never makes sense unless you know how the original authors wrote. Show Bill Joy's vi keyboard with the arrows on the letter keys.
- Start to get into our history.

### /usr/share/man

The man dialogue.
- 0 shows 1 the first edition Unix man pages.

### /dev

- Now that we found the Sudocode backup from the old pre-refactor, check it carefully to see if we missed any indexing in addition to the Linus ones. Most indexing was before the refactor. This matters!

- Add Phil Wadler directory.

- Add a constructivism directory with some talks by Andrej Bauer.

- Format Simon Peyton Jones - Escaping the Ivory Tower.
