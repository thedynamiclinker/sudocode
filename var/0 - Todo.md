- /home/user/bin/hello: Refactor this. It's not pleasant to read, so it's not good sudo code. This part should be less chaotic, and more direct. Be didactic here, not just socratic. Then at the end of it, add a principle to `/etc/principles/00-finish-hello-world`.

- /lib/ld.so: Write the "We are the foundational people" dialogue. This is how the foundations book becomes sudocode. At the end, add a principle: `/etc/principles/01-we-are-the-foundational-people`.

- /bin/sh:  This should really be all about the shell. The "languages are a scam" bit belongs here. Talk about the Thompson shell, the Bourne shell, then Bash, and how Bash has been neglected and really has no "community." This also needs a principle at the end, like `/etc/principles/02-learn-to-love-the-shell`.

### /dev

- Now that we found the Sudocode backup from the old pre-refactor, check it carefully to see if we missed any indexing in addition to the Linus ones. Most indexing was before the refactor. This matters!

- Add Phil Wadler directory.

- Add a constructivism directory with some talks by Andrej Bauer.

- Format Simon Peyton Jones - Escaping the Ivory Tower.
