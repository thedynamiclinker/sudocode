### @world

Contact Chet Ramey, explain that you've found a bug, and would like to include it in a book. The book is called "sudo code", and it's a series of technical dialogues between two characters, 0 and 1. The 0 character is a sort of teacher figure, 1 is younger and more in touch with modern side of computing, but less aware of our shared history (Unix, C, GNU, and important things like who Chet Ramey is.)

I'm a former Basic Books author and I've already published a book that was translated into 6 languages by various publishers around the world, so I know enough of the process that I think the project is pretty realistic and within the achievable range given my personal set of skills && flaws, the latter of which is a larger set than the former, but at least I know enough of computing to write a book that might plausibly be something unique.

I'm sure you're busy so I don't want to bother you unnecessarily, but I'm also reasonably confident that you don't have a TON of requests coming in asking if you'd like to be involved in a dialogue with two abstract characters named 0 and 1 about the history of computing, so I feel confident enough to gently nudge you in the direction of saying "Hey Chet, do this."

Hey Chet, do this.


### /lib/ld.so

The "Foundational People" dialogue.

Oh are you religious? What no read the link again. "...as a way of avoiding writing any name of God out in full." Why else would you avoid writing out the name of God in full? ...To save keystrokes. To save keystrokes? Why does anyone avoid typing anything in full? Because it's long. This is an ancient principle among our people. Who's our people? Unix. Well, not really. But they're the closest thing to our people's modern representatives. Mention i18n an l10n. Cover no vowels. Cover ld as "dynamic linker" and writing backwards. Cover the logo. 
- Well there's a lot of stuff in life that never makes sense unless you know how the original authors wrote. Show Bill Joy's vi keyboard with the arrows on the letter keys.
- Start to get into our history.

### /usr/share/man

The man dialogue.
- 0 shows 1 the first edition Unix man pages.

### /dev

- Now that we found the Sudocode backup from the old pre-refactor, check it carefully to see if we missed any indexing in addition to the Linus ones. Most indexing was before the refactor. This matters!

- Add Phil Wadler directory.

- Add a constructivism directory with some talks by Andrej Bauer.

- Format Simon Peyton Jones - Escaping the Ivory Tower.
