#### The ⟂-docs
Pronounced "Orthodox." The orthogonal documents. Refers to theoretical computer science, primary computability and complexity as elaborated in the decades since the lambdas and the mus split. Though it appears on the surface to be the same culture, it is mostly orthogonal to the history of our people.

#### The Trinity

The Church:
- Al
- Onzo

The Göd:
- El
- Kurt

The Martyr:
- Al

Word was spread to the masses by:

The Epistolary Apostle:
- Steve
- "Kleenelines is next to Gödeliness."
#### antigist
1: What was the point of showing me all that code I didn't understand back in /opt/art? And why was it in a file calle---

0: Antigist.

1: What?

0: That's why I showed you. It's important in our field to give the Antigist of things whenever possible.

1: The... an---

0: Antigist. Exactly.

1: Is that like the opposite of Tigist?

0: What? No. Why would it be that?

1: You know, like anaerobic, anemia, anarchy. The "an" means "opposite."

0: ...Not here.

1: So it's not the opposite of Tigist?

0: What's Tigist?

1: I dunno.

0: Anti-gist.

1: Oh!

0: The opposite of gist.

1: Why would that be a good thing?

0: Are you kidding? It's a great thing! Especially important in our field. 

1: But wait, "gist" is like... the only part you need to understand, right?

0: Absolutely not.

1: You don't like the "gist" of things?

0: I never said that. I love "gist." The gist of things is usually the most important part.

1: I'm so confused. Isn't that what I said?

0: Not even a little.

1: Explain?

### visit databases as a location of a file system and be like this is a f****** abomination 


### /opt/art

- [ ] Need to explain eventually that:

- The art means "arithmetic run time."

- To be explained once we get to the man dialogue and see brt1 and brt2 in early Unix.

- Need to explain crt1.o, crti.o, crtn.o too.

- The crt files live in /lib. The brt files lived in /etc. No one seems to know where to put these, so the "a" files go in /opt.

- A good time to explain the crt files is probably somewhere around the babel dialogue. There we can cover the original hope of cross language code sharing at the object file and linker level, and show what happens if we do it naively.
- Much like crt gets linked into every C program, formal Arithmetic (and incompleteness) gets linked into any formal system strong enough to express Arithmetic.

### @world

Contact Chet Ramey, explain that you've found a bug, and would like to include it in a book. The book is called "sudo code", and it's a series of technical dialogues between two characters, 0 and 1. The 0 character is a sort of teacher figure, 1 is younger and more in touch with modern side of computing, but less aware of our shared history (Unix, C, GNU, and important things like who Chet Ramey is.)

I'm a former Basic Books author and I've already published a book that was translated into 6 languages by various publishers around the world, so I know enough of the process that I think the project is pretty realistic and within the achievable range given my personal set of skills && flaws, the latter of which is a larger set than the former, but at least I know enough of computing to write a book that might plausibly be something unique.

I'm sure you're busy so I don't want to bother you unnecessarily, but I'm also reasonably confident that you don't have a TON of requests coming in asking if you'd like to be involved in a dialogue with two abstract characters named 0 and 1 about the history of computing, so I feel confident enough to gently nudge you in the direction of saying "Hey Chet, do this."

Hey Chet, do this.

Oh are you religious? What no read the link again. "...as a way of avoiding writing any name of God out in full." Why else would you avoid writing out the name of God in full? ...To save keystrokes. To save keystrokes? Why does anyone avoid typing anything in full? Because it's long. This is an ancient principle among our people. Who's our people? Unix. Well, not really. But they're the closest thing to our people's modern representatives. Mention i18n an l10n. Cover no vowels. Cover ld as "dynamic linker" and writing backwards. Cover the logo. 
- Well there's a lot of stuff in life that never makes sense unless you know how the original authors wrote. Show Bill Joy's vi keyboard with the arrows on the letter keys.
- Start to get into our history.

### /usr/share/man

The man dialogue.
