Occasionally root and user should issue a syscall which traps execution up into the kernel, at which point the Authors should monologue a bit about the data format of bibles and talk about Friedman's research and some basic OTL stuff.

Assorted things I removed from the main text:

> [!bible-note] Bible Note:
> Bibles are like that. They have a tendency to switch seamlessly between Authors without saying when they did or who's writing. Just like codebases. You'd be surprised at the similarities. Bibles are more like a codebase than any other type of document. That can make these bible things a bit jarring to read, but it's one of the many things we have to do, in aiming to emulate the deep structure of these objects, not just the surface structure. More on that below.

Not to superficially parrot them (as has been done countless times) by writing unhelpful sentences like "Ken begat Unix, and Unix begat C."

> [!bible] Bible Note:
> The PoC || GTFO volumes on stunt hacking and computing culture are a very good example of how wrapping a volume in surface level bible-ese can make its content more memorable and funny, while at the same time contributing little of lasting value except extra entertainment and good vibes. This sentiment is not shared by all the Authors of the present volume, however, some of whom object to the previous sentence, and would like to state unequivocally: We love PoC || GTFO, long live its many authors, and Godspeed, Travis Goodspeed.
