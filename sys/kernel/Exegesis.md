## Axioms

In this file, we the Authors make our first attempt, from a developers perspective, to reverse engineer the bible data format.

We assume the following as given:

- The authors of the bible were human. 
- Therefore, both as regards their individual personalities, and as regards the cultures from which they came, we assume the authors of the bible possessed (at least on average) the attributes that have been documented in all known human cultures. For a list of these attributes, see [[Universals]].
- By "on average," we mean that while individual human beings may lack, for example, empathy (in psychopathy) or theory of mind (in autism), on average in any group, most members will possess most human universals, both individually (as cognitive capacities) and culturally (as general features of the cultures to which they belong).

Given these assumptions, we now proceed to our reverse engineering analysis of the bible data format.

## Disassembly

Give examples of the following:

- Thinly veiled jokes about nearby tribes 1: Incestuous birth for Moab and Ammon in the story of Lot's daughters, analogous to a modern story of incest where the children are called Alabama and Mississippi.
- Thinly veiled jokes about nearby tribes 2: "Give me this red stuff" for Edom in the Jacob Esau story. Edom sounds like red in Hebrew, and is right below Israel and Judah in the Authors' time. Genesis 25:29-33 is the equivalent of the "24 dollars worth of beads" story in American history.

TODO: Merge this with the commentary on Genesis which (I think) is currently somewhere in zero, possibly in the man formats directory.

Ok so...

Genesis 27. Isaac is old and dying. He asks for some of that food he loves so much. They send Esau out to hunt for food because I guess they don't have any? Then once he's gone, the mom goes "Ok Jacob listen up, go out in the yard and get one of our goats because we already have a bunch of goats (lol what?) and I'll cook them, then you can pretend to be Esau and bring them to your dad. He won't know the difference. He's basically blind and senile."

Then Jacob goes "Ma, c'mon, Esau is really hairy and I'm all smooth. Dad's gonna notice. And then his dying words are gonna be all like fuck you Jacob."

So the mom goes "Whatever, tell him to blame me. Just follow my lead."

Then she LITERALLY goes and takes hairy brother's clothes and puts them on Jacob, and then puts goat skin from the food goats onto his hands and the smooth part of his neck.

She goats out her smooth son because OBVIOUSLY this is normal motherly behavior and not at all a joke about Edom, the tribe right below Israel and Judah who Esau represents.

So mom dresses Jacob in goat skin like silence of the fucking lambs, and sends him to her senile husband like "Hey dad, it's me the hairy one. I goat (ahem) I mean got you some food."

And dad's like "That was quick." Then just for the lols he's like "Is that you my son? Let me feel you."

So the dad feels his smooth son who's currently dressed in a makeshift goat costume, and the dad goes:

"The voice is the voice of Jacob, and the hands are the hands of Esau."

Tell me this isn't fucking satire.

Rachel's name means "sheep", she shows up with a bunch of sheep in Gen 29.
