[^1]: The short fragment above is notable only for being followed by a sequence of incomprehensible symbols (ʘ ǀ ǁ ǂ ǃ) repeated in various patterns over and over for around a paragraph of vertical space. On further inspection, these symbols were discovered to be an obscure subset of an extension of the International Phonetic Alphabet used only for representing the language of the !Kung San people and the various clicking sounds their language is known for. Attempts at a translation of this mysterious paragraph of !Kung has not yet borne the fruit one might have hoped, to put it mildly.
