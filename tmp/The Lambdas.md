Need to cover SPJ, Wadler, the catedgral, Church, and how they went off into the woods for about 90 years and now everyone's very suddenly realizing they were right about almost everything.

Cover Nix in and Eelco in this thread.

What are the "threads" in the FHS model? Clearly user directories. Where to put them?

Need to incorporate this somehow, it's too funny not to.

Cover the Y combinator.

Church and Kleene.

The Lambda Cube.

Dependent types.

Eventually becoming mathematics.

Godel being so unconvinced by lambda calculus that learning its equivalence with general recursive functions actually convinced him that HE was wrong.

Church and Kleene not even believing you could implement "minus one" in lambda calculus.

The big surprise: Computation is universal. Discovered not invented.
