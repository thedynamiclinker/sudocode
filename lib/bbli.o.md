0: What about this?

1: What's "this"?

0: This file.

1: Well this is the third file with bbl\*o in the name. What's bbli.o?

0: It's pronounced "biblio." It's a bibliography. Previous research in the topic of what you and I are here to do. The file before this was bbln.o aka "bible no." It was an example of what we're _not_ here to do. A bible's not just a big thick book about computing. Before that in bbl1 we were studying bible 1. The original. To figure out which bits are accidental and which are the sort of thing we want to do.

1: Was I supposed to know all that?

0: No. You were supposed to recognize the similarity with crt{1,i,n}.o but you didn't.

1: What are---

0: And then you started complaining we weren't doing enough "advanced programming" so I hacked this file together in 5 minutes and got us here quick to make a point.

1: Am I allowed to ask what the point is?

0: Yes.

1: What's the point?

## Previous  /re/ { search }

0: Previous research.

1: Previous research on wh---

0: On what we came here to do.

1: Which is wh---

0: What's a bible?

1: I said I don't kno---

0: Our field is missing something. We already saw one big book about computing that called itself that. But it obviously wasn't the sort of thing our field is missing.

1: Are you sure I'm the right person to help you wr---

0: Yes. In this file we'll be looking at some previous research in the field of writing bibles. One's about computing and its culture and who we are. There's no two. But below is a much better example of the kind of book that you and I need to write. And despite that, it still isn't right. In fact it's off by a mile and not remotely where we're heading. That said, it's a very good book, and in lots of ways it hit the mark of where we're heading.

1: What do you want me to do?

0: I want you to flip through it with me, and try to figure out which bits hit the mark and which didn't, so you and I can get a better idea of where we're heading and what to do.

1: But I don't know where we're headi---

0: Doesn't matter. Follow me.

![[poc-or-gtfo-01.jpg]]

0: This is the international journal of Proof of Concept Or Get The Fuck Out.

1: Omg I already love this.

0: It's bound like a bible.

1: What's it about?

![[poc-or-gtfo-02.jpg]]

0: Nothing.

1: What?

0: And everything. It's a pretty weird book. They can explain better than I can. Let's listen.

![[poc-or-gtfo-03.jpg]]

1: Can you be more like this? I wouldn't mind all your bible stuff if was like this.

0: That's why we're here. Keep reading.

![[poc-or-gtfo-04.jpg]]

0: There's an ASCII -- or not quite ASCII -- but spiritually ASCII-like image of presumably the chief compiler in a priest suit.

1: A priest suit?

0: Look I don't know what they're called. Keep reading.

![[poc-or-gtfo-05.jpg]]

0: Seems like the book started because they hated academic publishing and got drunk.

1: Sounds like a good start for a bible.

![[poc-or-gtfo-06.jpg]]

0: Here's one thing they got absolutely right.

1: Which is?

![[poc-or-gtfo-07.jpg]]

0: A near religious emphasis on the dynamic linker / loader.

1: Woah. I thought that was just you being weird.

![[poc-or-gtfo-10.jpg]]

0: Citing nonexistent sources. Staple of the bible genre.

![[poc-or-gtfo-11.jpg]]

1: Damn they really love the linker.

![[poc-or-gtfo-12.jpg]]

1: Or the loader. Still not clear on the difference.

0: We'll get there.

1: Either way, they seem to love it.

![[poc-or-gtfo-13.jpg]]

1: These people talk about `ld` almost as much as you do.

0: True. But don't lose the forest for the trees. This isn't just about `ld`. We're talking about big issues here. Good and Evil.

1: I haven't seen anything about good and evil in here yet.

![[poc-or-gtfo-14.jpg]]

1: Dammit, sometimes I feel like you're just setting me up on purpose.

0: You can do the same to me any time. We're supposed to be writing this book together after all.

1: I don't feel like we've actually started writing a book yet.

0: Maybe you haven't. But we're in this file to help you learn where we need to go.

![[poc-or-gtfo-15.jpg]]

1: Damn they seriously love the linker.

0: Hard requirement for any computing bible.

1: I don't think I have the first idea of what you're getting at with the LD thing. But it's weird to see these people sort of act the same way.

0: Here's another one.

![[poc-or-gtfo-16.jpg]]

1: What was that?

0: Ozymandias reference.

1: What?

0: Absolute necessity. Another thing they got right.

1: You have a lot of opinions.

0: Not true.

1: You don't think you have lots of opinions?

0: I wouldn't call them that.

1: What would you call them.

0: First principles.

1: _(Rolls eyes)_

![[poc-or-gtfo-17.jpg]]

1: There's LD again!

0: They even capitalized it this time.

1: This is getting freaky.

![[poc-or-gtfo-18.jpg]]

0: Any proper bible needs magic.

1: Elf magic?

0: Tolkien's as much of a bible author as anyone. Ever read the Silmarillion?

1: No.

0: Extremely bible. Even more so than the "bible" bible in some places. Dude constantly referenced the Silmarillion throughout Lord of the Rings as if you were just supposed to know it, even though he never even published the Silmarillion while he was alive. Extremely bible-author behavior. Plus he got the divine council right which was mostly edited out by the latter day redactors of bbl1. Dude was a king.

1: I maintain that you have opinions. Lots of th---

0: Ooh look down here. More necessities.

![[poc-or-gtfo-19.jpg]]

0: Makefiles.

1: What's this one about?

0: Good and evil.

![[poc-or-gtfo-20.jpg]]

1: Good and evil?

0: Yep. Another must have: C code. Hey there's crt.o! The thing you didn't know about.

1: If I learn these things will you shut up and stop making fun of me for not knowing about them?

0: Of course.

1: How can I be sure?

0: Because then you'll know them.

![[poc-or-gtfo-21.jpg]]

0: Hello world immediately followed by /bin/sh.

1: There really are some eerie similarities.

0: Basic issue of good and evil.

1: What?

0: In the headers: good & evil, c?

![[poc-or-gtfo-08.png]]

1: Who's Barnaby Jack?

0: ARE YOU KIDDING?

1: ...no?

0: There's so much we need to cover.

1: And yet why do I sense that you're not going to expl---

![[barnaby-jack-1.png]]

0: Barnaby Jack. Legendary hacker. Used to jackpot ATMs and hack medical devices.

1: Damn!

0: True rockstar.

1: Sounds like it.

0: Sadly.

1: What?

![[barnaby-jack-2.png]]

0: Rockstars tend to...

1: Oh.

0: One of the immortals.

![[poc-or-gtfo-09.jpg]]

0: Int80. Good name.

1: Why is th---

0: Oh c'mon, I can't explain everything.

1: I'm just curi---

0: Notice them mentioning "The usual academic nonsense." Another necessity for any bible.

1: Disliking academia?

0: Distrust of institutions.

1: I thought bibles were all about institutions.

0: Not the authors.

![[poc-or-gtfo-22.jpg]]

0: Latex slang.

1: Like rubber?

0: Jesus Christ, child.

1: What?

![[poc-or-gtfo-23.jpg]]

0: Ooh this part is good.

![[poc-or-gtfo-24.jpg]]

1: Does that strings command really work?

0: Of course. That's the Genesis Block.

1: Do you always make everything about bibles or---

![[bitcoin-genesis-block.jpg]]

0: That's what they call it. There's stuff about banks in there too.

1: Oh.

![[poc-or-gtfo-25.jpg]]

0: Aleph1. Good name.

1: What's Aleph1?

0: Cantor reference.

1: Who's Cantor?

0: We didn't do Cantor yet?

1: I don't think so.

0: Hmm, I must have refactored. We'll get there soon.

![[poc-or-gtfo-26.jpg]]

0: Another staple.

1: What is?

0: A proper bible about computing shouldn't just be about toy problems and old stuff. There should be some new bugs in major codebases that no one knew about before.

1: What about like, "responsible disclosure"?

0: What's more responsible than a book? Plus I never said exploit.

![[poc-or-gtfo-27.jpg]]

1: What's a straw hat?

0: Someone who brings people together.

![[poc-or-gtfo-28.jpg]]

1: This is quite the sermon.

![[poc-or-gtfo-29.jpg]]

1: "Look at these sinners!" ðŸ˜‚

0: What about it?

1: This book is great. Can we make our book like this?

0: Are you saying you want to make our book more bible?

1: Maybe.

![[poc-or-gtfo-30.jpg]]

1: Machine language for edification.

![[poc-or-gtfo-31.jpg]]

0: "And a light shines in the darkness. But the darkness did not understand it."

1: What?

![[poc-or-gtfo-32.jpg]]

1: There they go about the loader again!

![[poc-or-gtfo-33.jpg]]

1: What are they trying to accomplish here?

0: Nothing.

1: What? What do you mean nothing?

0: I mean nothing. That book doesn't really have a point.

1: The book we just read. It's pointless?

0: In a sense.

1: I thought you liked it!

0: I love it.

1: Then what do you mean it's---

0: It's not pointless, that's unfair. But it's not why we're here.

1: Why who're where?

0: You and me. We're not here to write something like that.

1: I think I enjoyed that book more than this one so fa---

0: That's why I showed it to you.

1: Because you thought I'd like it?

0: Yes.

1: So what's the problem?

0: It's not a bible.

1: It sure looks lik---

0: It's a Talmud.

1: What's a Talmud.

![[poc-or-gtfo-is-a-talmud-not-a-bible.png]]

0: It's a big book. But it's for experts.

1: I'm a professional develo---

0: But you're not an expert. At least not in this sense.

1: Hey!

0: PoC || GTFO is a wonderful book.

1: So what's your complaint exactly?

0: No complaints. But it's a Talmud.

1: You can't just keep repeati---

0: It's a big book for experts. Where they compete with arguments and essays and feats of intellect to impress each other. It's rabbinical. They said themselves, that book was a walled garden, a happy place for "our culture", something they made because we're not allowed to be ourselves in the academic literature. But it's not a bible.

1: What's a bible?

0: The thing they all shared that allowed them to write that.

1: What thing? Like an interest in computers?

0: That book was more than just people with a shared interest in computers. That was world experts and brilliant kids doing technical backflips and making obscure references to our culture that they can't usually share with people in the outside world, but could share with each other, because of something else they shared.

1: What kind of "something else"?

0: A shared culture. A shared history. A shared set of stories and experiences.

1: I don't think that's the reason I enjoyed that book.

0: Plus a large amount of extremely technical knowledge and skills.

1: That part. I liked that it was about low-level technical stuff, but also silly, and not boring.

0: I think your reason is a subset of my reason.

1: How so?

0: The low-level technical stuff. That's our culture.

1: Fair point.

0: And the silly irreverent not boring stuff.

1: What about it?

0: That's our culture too.

1: I'm less convinced of that.

0: Why?

1: Most technical writing is extremely dry, not silly, and very boring.

0: Whose fault do you think that is?

1: I dunno. The authors?

0: Couldn't be more wrong.

1: Whose is it then?

0: Who do you think we are?

1: What?

0: Who are we?

1: You and me? Or our field in gen---

0: Come with me.
