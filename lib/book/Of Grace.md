Of course a few years later a few people admitted that maybe you could use assembly language. But the entire establishment was firmly convinced that the only way to write an efficient program was in octal._

> _They totally forgot what happened to me when I joined Eckert-Mauchly. They were building BINAC, a binary computer. We programmed it in octal. Thinking I was still a mathematician, I taught myself to add, subtract, and multiply, and even divide in octal. I was really good, until the end of the month, and then my check- book didn't balance! (Laughter) It stayed out of balance for three months until I got hold of my brother who's a banker. After several evenings of work he informed me that at intervals I had subtracted in octal. And I faced the major problem of living in two different worlds. That may have been one of the things that sent me to get rid of octal as far as possible._
