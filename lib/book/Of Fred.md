> _\[Compared to the IBM 704\] the 1105 was faster. It had an 8 microsecond memory not 12. It had 2 address instructions not 1 address instructions so each address was more powerful. But it was tape only. And so, you'd put your cards into a card to tape converter, you took the tape over to the machine and mounted it, you ran your problem, then you took your tape with the answer on it back and mounted it and printed off your results. Whereas the 704 had directly attached card reader and printer. My recollection is that when the last card of your program had disappeared into the reader, the printer started burping almost immediately dumping your memory for where you'd made a mistake or a bug.
