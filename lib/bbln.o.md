0: What bbl thing?

1: The file names.

0: If you were as interested in low-level programming as you claim to be, you'd know.

1: Look you're not supposed to hit back. You're the teache---

0: I brought you here because you kept bitching about wanting more programming and less bible.

1: I wouldn't say I was bitching.

0: But you're not here just to read bibles.

1: Are you sure?

0: You're here to write one.

1: Write one?

0: With me. That's why we're here.

1: _(Silently confused)_

0: Our field is confused about its history, young developers are lost, non-technicals at our jobs spout bullshit about the so called best practices of our field and we the developers usually don't have the courage of our convictions to speak up. What is our field? Where did we come from? What the hell is a "best practice" anyway and how can we tell? You're not wrong to be skeptical, it's normal to wonder if everything you thought you knew was marketing. There's a lot of marketing in our field that tries to tell us what's a necessity, what's best, that you're not a real developer unless you do X, and that bullshit never stops. What principles do you use to sniff out truth from bullshit? How do you tell which is which, in all those times it's not clear? The answer can't be "listen to me" your whole life so what is it? What's your answer going to be when I'm not around anymore? What does our field have to show for all this work over all these years? Machines? Software? What have we really learned? Is any of it timeless, or it is all corporations distracting us with shiny new machines and sales teams telling us the highest good is a cloud scale five nines vector database? How do you know which subset of your beliefs came from marketing and which came from something you really believe?

1: _(Slightly intimidated)_ I don't know.

0: What's a bible?

1: _(Mostly immobile)_ I don't know.

0: If it was your job to write one for our field, what would you do?

1: _(Discomfort slowly decreasing)_ ... I don't know.

0: Would you write this?

![[bible-definition-we-dont-just-mean-a-thick-book.jpg]]

1: What do you mean?

0: It's a big thick book. It says bible. Is that what we want?

1: I've never read this bo---

0: But you can tell.

1: Tell what?

0: In what sense is this a bible?

1: It says comprehensive.

0: And?

1: Tutorial.

0: What else?

1: It's big.

0: Is that what you'd write?

1: What's the question?

0: If it was your job to write a bible for our field, is this enough?

1: Is what enough?

0: A big thick book.

1: ...No?

0: Correct. That's not enough.
