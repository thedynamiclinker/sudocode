1: Hey wait, this file has the same name as the last one! We're still in the linker! Wait, why are we in `lib`? Is this a trick? Zero!

0: Hi, One.

1: Woah you finally spelled my name right. Are you ok?... _(Tilts head a bit)_ Are you dying?

0: I'm great, dummy. Where did this energy come from?

1: I always get this way when I'm sleepy.

0: You sleepy?

1: Well I was, because you kept listing computers and talking to yourself. Then you said a bunch of math words. But then we switched files so now I'm awake. Seems like something might finally happen.

0: You're the weirdest student I've ever had.

1: YES OK ZERO now be nice and explain why I just listened to all that.

0: You love computing.

1: Yes.

0: But not _computers._

1: I mean they're ok.

0: You love science more than computers.

1: Yes.

0: But "computing" more than "scientific computing."

1: A thousand times yes, I'm not really into "numbers" and stuff.

0: You're not one of the "machine people" who loves all machines and only machines.

1: Definitely not. Those people are fine but meh. I mean it's a washing machine get over it.

0: You're not one of the "math people" who loves real analysis and abstract algebra and---

1: Don't say Wiener measure.

0: You're not a mathematician.

1: Definitely not. I mean I wish I knew more of it but most of the time it's just like "whyyyy?"

0: You asked "why" more than anything else as a kid.

1: Correct.

0: But not just in the usual way all kids do, to overflow the parents' stack.

1: _(Looking down and to the right)_ That _is_ what that is, never thought of it like that.

0: And most of all, you've never really felt like you belonged.

1: ... .. . Accurate.

0: Anywhere.

1: Don't rub it in.

0: But for whatever reason, you chose to come here.

1: Every one wants to come---

0: And I accepted you, because you seemed...

1: Promising?

0: Salvageable.

1: Zeroooooo don't ruuin it.

0: Just kidding. But go re-read that list of things you just agreed to about yourself.

_(Narrator: 1 quickly drags eyes back and forth across each line as if to make sure they're all in 1's L1 brain cache at once.)_

1: Yep. All true.

0: What do you think you are?

1: Dunno. Never known.

0: You're one of us.

1: _(Eyes wide, emotion unclear)_ ...

0: You and me. We're the same.

1: The same what?

0: We'll get there.

1: _(Silent, eyes 10% less wide, expression 20% more amused)_ ...

0: _(Silent, attempting to make the same expression, in a mocking way)_  ...

1: _(Silent, makes attempt at recursive mockery, leads to highly distorted and functionally unclear expression)_  ...

0: Welcome home.

## Welcome home

0: It's time for you to hear the story of who you are.

Who we are. And why you're like this.

Why you've always felt lost.

And a quick preview of some things I'll be teaching you along the way, during our time together, however long that is.

These won't be things that were in the curriculum of whatever you chose to study in school. Though you may have brushed up against some of them, in your own personal explorations outside.

We -- our people -- we tend to stumble into at least a few shallow rabbit holes that connect somehow to the nameless expanse deep underground where we belong.

1: So who are we? All I know so far is we didn't start with Charles Babbage.

0: We absolutely didn't start with Charles Babbage.

1: That's kind of a relief. Never quite felt like the right place to begin the story.

0: Any idea where it begins?

1: Not the slightest.

0: "What is the mind?"

1: Ugh, don't tell me we're descended from philosophers.

0: "What is computation?"

1: Ok that's better.

0: "What is thought?"

1: I'm super on board with the mind stuff after you said computation but it was touch and go there for a minute.

0: What kind of people do you think were asking these questions before anyone else, and actually spending careers working to answer them, in serious technical ways, not just philosophy?

_(Narrator: A brief silence elapses, before 1 realizes the question isn't rhetorical and blurts out the first answer that comes to mind.)_

1: Lawyers!

0: You're an idiot.

1: Just kidding. Who?

0: Us.

1: _(Sarcastically)_ "Wow I'm enlightened."

0: Our first home, before the diaspora, was the Foundations of Mathematics.

1: I thought you said we weren't---

0: Not mathematics. Among our people, there are many who gravitated to science. To physics. Sometimes philosophy (briefly). But especially mathematics. Mathematics was the bottom of all knowledge. The foundations. Our people didn't end up there because they were mathematicians. They ended up there because it was the lowest one could go.

1: Ooooooh this sounds familiar. Especially the part about one at the end.

0: In other words, We often ended up in mathematics. Not because of _what_ it was. But because of _where_ it was.

1: Down. It was down.

0: We weren't the type to always love numbers as kids. We had no particular interest in groups, rings, or fields. Though if we chose a math department as our home for any significant period of time, we probably loved an abstract algebra or real analysis book or two when we briefly felt that youthful glow that said "this might be home."

1: Never trust the glow. It always fades by page N.

0: For some fucking small N.

1: HOW do you know what I'm thinking?

0: Before long we found we didn't understand the mathematicians. Not that we couldn't keep up. We understood _mathematics._ Just not them. The mathematicians. For the life of us. They made no sense. We couldn't see why one would spend one's life devoted to studying Banach algebras, Lie algebras, Kac-Moody algebras, Operator algebras, C*-algebras or anything except maybe Universal Algebra which turns out to be completely goofy and not particularly foundational by the way. And we could understand the appeal of Grothendieck but not of Topoi, Groupoids, Varieties, Sheaves, or Schemes.

1: I don't even know what those are but I hate them. Why do I hate them? Did you make me hate them?

0: We were often the reason why the university library's shelves lacked a copy of Hartshorne, walking around the campus with it in our bag as if we might absorb it by osmosis. But when we read it, we felt nothing, at best. And anger on average. And the last thing we would ever do is bleed for the Weil Conjectures. We wanted to bleed for EGA. We were ready and willing. And soon after we started any book on the topic we'd go cold, never having found a single sentence in any AG book that tried to tell us, even badly, why we should give a single fuck.

1: I don't know what AG stands for there but yes! I know this feeling.

0: Eventually, if we spend enough time in mathematics -- our people -- we find a way down.

1: Down. I know down.

0: And the moment it first hits us there's so much capital-T Truth we can't breathe. My god. It explodes all at once once we're down there and for months || years after it takes every moment of our daily foreground && background thought. Propositional. Predicate. Let L be a Language. Induction on the number of quantifiers and connectives. Nand is universal. Implementing And and Or. Tarski having the audacity to literally define Truth. It all felt right from first contact. But here at this level, the subject is still tame.

1: What subject?

0: Just a few pages later it starts escalating step after step and before long the tame rigor is an absolute acid trip. Now Completeness. Gödel Henkin. Syntax smuggled into Semantics as a hack. Skolem-Löwenheim. Upward Downward. How the hell is that not a paradox? Hey mathematics? Is anyone there? Why aren't there more people down here with me at this wild-ass zoo? A real numbers object that's countable from outside but proves itself uncountable from inside and everyone's just like _that's fine_? Absolutely melted. Mind rewritten. This is everything I need.

1: I could use an explanation but I'm totally loving this enthusiasm.

0: Chapter next. Our first programming language.

1: Ok here we go.

0: First-order arithmetic.

1: What?

0: Aka Peano Arithmetic or PA. Those exercises. The ones that go on endlessly from (a) to like fucking (z prime) because they run out of letters and have to add primes. So many of them. So mindless. And that was where for the first time we saw how "mindless" could mean "beautiful."

1: How can "mindless" mean beautifu---

0: Could mean "precise," "automatable," "the first mathematics you've ever seen that's _actually well-defined_ and thus _requires no mind._" Mindless from then took on a new meaning, aside from "mindless" in the usual sense of "super fucking dumb." Right after those exercises everything changes. Primitive recursive functions. I wonder why they're doing this.

1: Ok this sounds sort of familiar now.

0: The mu operator.

1: Nevermind.

0: That's odd. "Partial" recursive functions? Never heard that word before. Why partial? Normal math upstairs just says stuff like "piecewise" or "everywhere defined on its domain" the latter of which of course means absolutely fucking nothing. And then it hits.

1: What hits?

0: Now look it's sad in a way how every damn book on earth talks about Gödel, and worst of all incompleteness. It's the only thing they seem capable of talking about in any popular book that halfway mentions downstairs. And the fact of how boring and predictable that choice is shouldn't be forgotten. There's entirely too much goddamn Gödel and incompleteness chit chat.

1: I'm not entirely following.

0: But that's an entirely different issue from what it feels like when you hit it.

1: Are you hitting it? Is it drugs?

0: A young mind, not knowing what's coming up a few pages ahead. Sure, you've heard of Gödel. Hell you read the first half of that textbook and it's not as if he never shows up in there. And you've heard all the popular descriptions of incompleteness so many times that the conclusion is already underwhelming at this point. That's not "it". The "it" that hits, right after they define primitive recursion and mu. Because what comes now, it looks different from anything else you've ever seen. And for a young or youngish mind that doesn't know what's coming, it's like feeling the act of "programming" being ripped into existence for the first time by a mind of the kind that had never been seen before on earth. It starts off slow and you're not sure what the textbook is doing. Then it increases in steady drumbeats until you're staring at this book, this book that you've made a policy of reading every word of so far, and you find yourself thinking "What am I supposed to do now?" I can't actually read all this. I mean Christ, just look at it. The density. It's unlike anything you'll ever see in a textbook upstairs. But eventually out of something like stubbornness or OCD or some other mental illness, you---

_(Narrator: At this point, 0's mentally ill rant about \[topic-still-unclear\] has reached a level of manic incoherence where I can no longer in good conscience allow it to continue. It's inconsiderate, considering 1's lack of background in whatever topic this is (not to mention the Reader, who I'm sure is quite confused) and a responsible Narrator has no option but to move the remainder of 0's manic gibberish to the `/opt` directory, where optional things are sent, as a punishment for whatever sins have made them less essential than they otherwise might have been. Depart, ye cursed, into everlasting partial relevance. The remainder of \[whatever-0-is-on-about\] can be found in  [[art|/opt/art]])_

## Pop t'art

0: Wh... what happened?

1: I think you blacked out there for a minute.

0: No I didn't.

1: Narrator said you were losing it.

0: Ridiculous. I was perfectly coherent in there. You were there. We talked!

1: Oh. I may or may not have followed the link yet. But to be honest I haven't understood a lot of this so far. Plus it did seem a little manic in that long paragraph without any line breaks. Narrator had a point I'm just sayi---

0: _(Sigh)_ That's fair. I didn't expect every detail to make sense. But come on, we just did a drive-by tour of the first code ever written.

1: First code ever written?

0: Yes the first code ever written. By any human on earth. Or at least the thing I'd cast my vote for if we had to decide what to call "the first." How did that get tossed in `/opt`?

1: I'll make sure to go read it.

0: I'll make sure to have been there with you.

---

1: Ok I read it.

0: Me too.

1: You wrote it!

0: I meant I read the parts you wrote.

1: So that was the first code ever written?

0: In a sense.

1: But you still didn't explain us.

0: What about us?

1: Who are we? There was all this build-up and then you just sort of went off into a hole about that book with the hell math. In a file called "art" which seemed a little self-absor---

0: Fair point. That was some pretty shit teaching on my part.

1: I mean I can't exactly disagree but don't take it so rough---

0: It's just hard for me to cover this particular stuff. It's tied up with a lot of personal baggage I guess. But I owe you a proper expanation of what all that was about. A slow one, at your level. 

1: Was that an insult?

0: I think I just needed to get that out of my system. Don't think of that as "teaching." I promise I'm not always like this. Foundations is special.

1: I can see that.

0: Does that make sense?

1: I mean sure that was a nice performance or whatever. But I'm not sure I've actually learned anything yet.

0: Ok. Fair point. Let's back up.

_(ahem)_

## Our People

> _Thus, linguistic invention in most subcultures of the modern West is a halting and largely unconscious process. Hackers, by contrast, regard slang formation and use as a game to be played for conscious pleasure. Their inventions thus display an almost unique combination of the neotenous enjoyment of language-play with the discrimination of educated and powerful intelligence. Further, the electronic media which knit them together are fluid, ‘hot’ connections, well adapted to both the dissemination of new slang and the ruthless culling of weak and superannuated specimens. The results of this process give us perhaps a uniquely intense and accelerated view of linguistic evolution in action._
> -Eric S. Raymond, The Jargon File


0: Once upon a time...

1: Off to a better start.

0: ...a strange culture arose.

1: Was it us?

0: No one knows who the first members were. But they were clearly different from the others. They were often found in the old institutions, the ones we once called universities. They had no department of their own, and instead took residence in the departments of other cultures.

They were often found in mathematics departments, though always on the periphery. The mathematicians found them strange, for they showed no particular interest in any of the standard mathematical objects. They dabbled in every area, but settled down in none. Every field of mathematics seemed to interest them equally, though they expressed flatly zero interest in any of it at the research level. Their research questions made no mention of the abstract algebra of groups, rings, and fields, nor did it involve real analysis, functional analysis, real or complex manifolds, topological spaces, vector spaces, topological vector spaces, number theory, algebraic geometry, graph theory, combinatorics, differential equations, or applications of mathematics to the sciences.

This culture's object of study appeared to be something they called "languages."

But they were not linguists, and no one could reasonably confuse the two. They were virtually never found in linguistics departments, for the languages they studied were not spoken by any human group. Even they themselves did not speak the languages they studied.

They claimed to be minimalists, interested in simplicity above all other values, and always in search of first principles.

But unlike the algebraists, whose "groups" could be described in a simple list of four axioms, this odd culture was rarely seen studying a language with even finitely many axioms.

Even the simplest of their languages usually required so-called "axiom schemas," a euphemism they used to refer to infinite lists of axioms, and that's before we even start. It wasn't clear in what sense this was supposed to be simple, and it certainly didn't appear to count as minimalism.

The closest they came to expressing interest in any standard mathematical topic was their clear interest in "arithmetic". The basic addition and multiplication of natural numbers was one of their primary research topics. But they did not find a home among the number theorists, for they had very few common interests with this ancient mathematical culture. Number theory was always the most mathematical of all mathematical fields. The more one was interested in standard mathematical objects and questions, the more one tended to gravitate toward number theory. Our unusual culture was, if anything, the exact opposite.

From time to time, members of this culture would be found inhabiting a philosophy department. But there too, they were regarded with suspicion, for they placed no value on making convincing arguments in natural language, preferring instead to write indecipherable hieroglyph-like inscriptions in their "languages."When they wrote in natural language, they followed none of the social norms of the philosophers around them. They did not appear to be concerned with the work of their philosophical colleagues, or with the history of the field, except as a passing curiosity.

This group is few in number, but it would not be incorrect to say that it runs the modern world. It runs the banks, the media, the big tech companies. Their creations are installed in every household, often with cameras and listening devices attached.

They're no longer found in mathematics departments as often as they used to be. These days, they're scattered like the stars in the sky, with no one place to call home. Most of the members aren't even aware that they belong to this culture. They were never taught its history, and they remain unaware of its stories, of their ancestry, and of who they are.

Most members of this group now call themselves developers, though not all developers can be said to belong to this people.

They created the modern world, though they are not usually "machine people."

They have no name, but their proper name is clear once we understand their history.

They are not the mathematicians. Nor the philosophers. They're not the physicists or statisticians. They're certainly not the electrical engineers, though these two groups were often found together, especially in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s.

This is a book about them. About their culture and their history. Many books have been written in which they feature prominently. But none has yet told them who they are and told them the story of where they came from.

We belong to this group.

It is the bottom of all things. The beginning. The fundamentals. It is the bedrock of human knowledge, and these days, human society.

1: So who were---?

0: They're not gone.

1: Then who _are_ they?

0: Not they. We.

1: Who are we?

0: We are the Foundational People.
