## So

1: Dammit this file has the same name as the last one! Don't tell me we're only halfway done with this lecture. Wait why are we in `lib`? Is this a trick? Zero!

0: Hi, One.

1: Woah you finally spelled my name right. Are you ok?... _(Tilts head a bit)_ Are you dying?

0: I'm great, dummy. Where did this energy come from?

1: I always get this way when I'm sleepy.

0: You sleepy?

1: Well I was, because you kept listing computers and talking to yourself. But then we switched files so now I'm awake. Seems like something might finally happen.

0: You're the weirdest student I've ever had.

1: YES OK ZERO now be nice and explain why I just listened to all that.

0: You love computing.

1: Yes.

0: But not _computers._

1: I mean they're ok.

0: You love science more than computers.

1: Yes.

0: But "computing" more than "scientific computing."

1: A thousand times yes, I'm not really into "numbers" and stuff.

0: You're not one of the "machine people" who loves all machines and only machines.

1: Definitely not. Those people are fine but meh. I mean it's a washing machine get over it.

0: You asked "why" more than anything else as a kid.

1: Correct.

0: But not just in the usual way all kids do, to overflow the parents' stack.

1: _(Looking down and to the right)_ That _is_ what that is, never thought of it like that.

0: And most of all, you've never really felt like you belonged.

1: ... .. . Accurate.

0: Anywhere.

1: Don't rub it in.

0: But for whatever reason, you chose to come here.

1: Every one wants to come---

0: And I accepted you, because you seemed...

1: Promising?

0: Salvageable.

1: Zeroooooo don't ruuin it.

0: Just kidding. But go re-read that list of things you just agreed to about yourself.

_(Narrator: 1 quickly drags eyes back and forth across each line as if to make sure they're all in 1's brain's L1 cache at once.)_

1: Yep. All true.

0: What do you think you are?

1: Dunno. Never known.

0: You're one of us.

1: _(Eyes wide, emotion unclear)_ ...

0: We're the Foundational People.

1: _(Silent, eyes 10% less wide, expression 20% more amused)_ ...

0: _(Silent, attempting to make the same expression, in a mocking way)_  ...

1: _(Silent, makes attempt at recursive mockery, leads to highly distorted and functionally unclear expression)_  ...

0: Welcome home.

## Welcome home

0: It's time for you to hear the story of who you are.

Who we are. And why you're like this.

Why you've always felt lost.

And a quick preview of some things I'll be teaching you along the way, during our time together, however long that is.

These won't be things that were in the curriculum of whatever you chose to study in school. Though you may have brushed up against some of them, in your own personal explorations outside.

We -- our people -- we tend to stumble into at least a few shallow rabbit holes that connect somehow to the nameless expanse deep underground where we belong.

1: So who are we? All I know so far is we didn't start with Charles Babbage.

0: We absolutely didn't start with Charles Babbage.

1: That's kind of a relief. Never quite felt like the right place to begin the story.

0: Any idea where it begins?

1: Not the slightest.

0: "What is the mind?"

1: Ugh, don't tell me we're descended from philosophers.

0: "What is computation?"

1: Ok that's better.

0: "What is thought?"

1: I'm super on board with the mind stuff after you said computation but it was touch and go there for a minute.

0: What kind of people do you think were asking these questions before anyone else, and actually spending careers working to answer them, in serious technical ways, not just philosophy?

_(Narrator: A brief silence elapses, before1 realizes the question is not rhetorical, and blurts out the first answer that comes to mind.)_

1: Lawyers!

0: You're an idiot.

1: Just kidding. Who?

0: The foundational people.

1: _(Sarcastically)_ "Hey that's us."

0: Our first home, before the diaspora, was the Foundations of Mathematics.

1: Oooh.

0: Not mathematics. Among us are many who gravitated to science. To physics. Sometimes philosophy (briefly). But especially mathematics. Mathematics was the bottom of all knowledge. The foundations. Our people didn't end up there because they were mathematicians. They ended up there because it was the lowest one could go.

1: Ooooooh this sounds familiar. Especially the part about one at the end.

0: In other words, We often ended up in mathematics. Not because of _what_ it was. But because of _where_ it was.

1: Down. It was down.

0: We weren't the type to always love numbers as kids. We had no particular interest in groups, rings, or fields. Though if we chose a math department as our home for any significant period of time, we probably loved an abstract algebra or real analysis book or two when we briefly felt that youthful glow that said "this might be home."

1: Never trust the glow. It always fades by page N.

0: For some fucking small N.

1: HOW do you know what I'm thinking?

0: Before long we found we didn't understand the mathematicians. Not that we couldn't keep up. We understood _mathematics._ Just not them. The mathematicians. For the life of us. They made no sense. We couldn't see why one would spend one's life devoted to studying Banach algebras, Lie algebras, Kac-Moody algebras, Operator algebras, C*-algebras or anything except maybe Universal Algebra which turned out to be completely insane. And we could understand the appeal of Grothendieck but not of Topoi, Groupoids, Varieties, Sheaves, or Schemes.

1: I don't even know what those are but I hate them. Why do I hate them? Did you make me hate them?

0: We were often the reason why the university library's shelves lacked a copy of Hartshorne, walking around the campus with it in our bag as if we might absorb it by osmosis. But when we read it, we felt nothing at best, and anger on average. And the last thing we would ever do is bleed for the Weil Conjectures. We wanted to bleed for EGA. We were ready and willing. And soon after we'd go cold, never having found a single sentence in any AG book that tried to tell us, even badly, why we should give a single fuck.

1: I don't know what AG stands for there but yes! I know this feeling.

0: Eventually, if we spend enough time in mathematics -- our people -- we find a way down.

1: Down. I know down.

0: And the moment it first hits us there's so much capital-T Truth we can't breath. My god. It explodes all at once into our ambient attention once we're down there. It takes every moment of our daily foreground and background thought. Propositional. Predicate. Completeness - GÃ¶del - Henkin & Syntax smuggled into Semantics as a hack. Skolem-Lowenheim. Upward Downward. How the fuck is this not a paradox? Why the hell aren't there more people down here at this wild ass zoo? A real numbers object that's countable from outside but proves itself uncountable from in here? Absolutely melted. Mind rewritten. This is everything I need.
