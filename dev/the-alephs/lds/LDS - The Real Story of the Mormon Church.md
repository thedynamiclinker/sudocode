### Joseph Smith's Church did indeed have a lot of the ingredients of the religious movements of the time. Last days, Apocalypse, preparing God's kingdom on the Earth, preparing for the Millennium. This was all trending at the time, this was not surprising. But! A lot of this stuff was totally new fringe doctrine. God has a body and a wife? This was a completely wild blend of Jewish folk mysticism, American folk magic, reincartion, evangelical Christianity, and eventually he even wove in Freemasonry. A totally fresh thing. There was nothing quite like it. It was super unique and super potent, and super polarizing.
