### Howard Aiken: The Boss. He loved to have an argument. If you pushed back, he respected you. If you didn't push back, he would run over you. And I _mean_ he ran over you.

### The IBM 704 vs the 1105. The 1105 was faster. It had an 8 microsecond memory not 12. It had 2 address instructions not 1 address instructions so each address was more powerful. But it was tape only. And so, you'd put your cards into a card to tape converter, you took the tape over to the machine and mounted it, you ran your problem, then you took your tape with the answer on it back and mounted it and printed off your results. Whereas the 704 had directly attached card reader and printer. My recollection is that when the last card of your program had disappeared into the reader, the printer started burping almost immediately dumping your memory for where you'd made a mistake or a bug. So what was the difference? The difference is the 1105 was designed for production. The 704 system would do quick turnaround for debugging. And as Wilkes had said earlier on "I learned early on that I was going to spend the rest of my life debugging."
