### The way God intended, well God or at least Church, that is Alonzo Church
start = 0:30
end = 1:00

### Lambda the ultimate
start = 1:00
end = 1:30

### Into this highly volatile mixture, God arrived, in the form of John Backus, and he gave the Turing award lecture under the title Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann style?
start = 2:30
end = 3:30

### And God had said, go forth and build new languages and better still, new computers to execute them, so off we went
start = 3:15
end = 3:35

### It's hard to explain what that was like, it's a bit like being on drugs, and boy did we inhale! And the result was chaos. Many languages, many compilers, many architectures, mostly doomed alas
start = 3:30
end = 4:50

### We all essentially have the same language, we just need to form a consensus in order to reduce unnecessary diversity - We had no idea what we were getting ourselves into
start = 4:35
end = 5:00

### Naming the language
start = 4:50
end = 6:10

### A meeting of working group 2.8 in Oxford in June 1992
start = 6:00
end = 7:00

### The shirt and throwing it into the audience
start = 6:45
end = 8:15

### The case for lazy evaluation was made in John's paper why functional programming matters which has become part of Holy Writ and is now written on tablets of stone
start = 14:20
end = 15:40

### Is laziness worth the cost? The really important thing is that it keeps you pure. Every call by value language has succumbed to the siren call of side effects. In a lazy language, you can't make those deals with the devil.
start = 15:30
end = 16:45

### Nirvana - The safe and useless vs unsafe and useful graph
start = 21:50
end = 23:00
