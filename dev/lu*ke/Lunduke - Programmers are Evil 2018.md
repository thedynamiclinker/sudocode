### I'm going to try to convince you that programmers are evil. Not that "there's some bad software out there", but that programmers, in their hearts, are bad people.

### I've also spent a lot of time managing software developers over the years. I know how awful they are. I know how black and icy and tar filled their hearts are. And that is what we're gonna talk about. And to start it out there's really no better way to prove this to you conclusively than to talk about Arkansas. So this is the state of Arkansas. Who's been to Arkansas? (Some people raise their hands.) Liars!

### What's amazing is the bigger and longer running a project is, the less code gets actually run. That doesn't mean the code can't be run, it means the developers of the code have forgotten how to run it.

### Software developers, did you intend to write code that would never get run? What that your purpose? Did you intend for significant portions of your functions to just stop being executed entirely? Never! Never, that's never the goal. You don't want to write code that never gets run. But it happens. You can't help it. Because in your heart you're driven by something black and dark. Is there another explanation?
