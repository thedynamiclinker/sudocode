### Python bans Tim Peters

### On August 7th 2024, the Python Software Foundation's Code of Conduct Working group (red flag right there) recommended a suspension of Tim Peters which was then implemented
start = 2:50
end = 3:07

### Some of the reasons for the suspension: (1) Defending reverse racism and reverse sexism concepts (2) Using potentially offensive language or slurs, in one case even calling an SNL skit from the 1970s using the same slur quote "Genuinely funny" which shows a lack of empathy towards other community members", and (3) Overloading the discussion of the bylaws change, 47 out of 177 posts, which created an atmosphere of fear uncertainty and doubt. Tim made the mistake of talking about his opinions more than the powers that be wanted him to. So he was suspended from the project.
