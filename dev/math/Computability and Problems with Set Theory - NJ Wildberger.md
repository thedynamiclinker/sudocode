### These axioms are the official doctrine - Remarkably, this is not just the official doctrine for set theory, it turns out that this is the official doctrine for mathematics! - Very few people seem to have a problem with that which I find quite remarkable

### I don't know what predominates in Cantor's theory, philosophy or theology, but I am sure there is no mathematics there

### Poincare - There is no actual infinity. That, the Cantorians have forgotten and been trapped by contradictions

### Hermann Weyl - Classical origin was abstracted from the mathematics of finite sets and their subsets. Forgetful of this limited origin, one afterwards mistook that logic for something above and prior to all mathematics and finally applied it witho justification to the mathematics of infinite sets. This is the fall and original sin of Cantor's set theory.

### Abraham Robinson, developer of non-standard analysis: Infinite totalitites do not exist in any sense of the word, either really or ideally. More precisely, any mention of infinite totalitites is literally meaningless.
