### Programming in the early 1950s really was fun. The computers we had to contend with presented us with such absurd difficulties. And if he'd read Wilkes Wheeler and Gill (The Preparation of Programs for an Electronic Digital Computer by Professor Sir Maurice Wilkes, David Wheeler and Stanley Gill) then he'd know about subroutines and calling sequences, otherwise he was on his own
start = 2:55
end = 5:00

### Someone glued an output tape into a MÃ¶bius strip
start = 5:00
end = 7:05

### Programming in the early 50s was a black art, you didn't have a manager who thought he knew how to do it, and it was largely untainted by the stuffiness of academia
start = 7:00
end = 9:00

### Lots of drinking and open flow of ideas, the ideas seemed to naturally belong to anyone who heard oned one
start = 9:00
end = 12:00

### Early on, it wasn't even obvious that "a compiler" _could_ be built! People generally thought programming was too complex and mental a skill to have the "optimized machine code generation" part done by a machine.
start = 20:00
end = 24:00

### Dick Hamming's history has understated how much opposition there was to an automatic coding system like Fortran
start = 33:00
end = 35:00
