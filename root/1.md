0: Ok 1, here's the deal.

1: Listening.

0: Everyone's wrong about everything.

1: This is "the very beginning"?

0: What?

1: You said we were going to start at the beginning.

0: Oh right. Yes, this is the beginning.

1: "Everyone's wrong about everything" is the beginning?

0: Yes.

1: How can that be the very beginning? Surely the existence of the people you claim are wrong preceded the fact of their being wr---

0: No. I mean yes, they did come first. But they're not the beginning. This is the beginning.

1: "In the beginning, there was everyone, and everyone was wrong, about everything."

0: Not just the languages. Language communities. Language conferences. Language dot org. How to install our Language. Language files full of Language code. Dot lang files. Language commands like `Pumpkin install` or whatever the f$@k you kids do these days. Languages, 1. It's all a scam. We've got the only language we need right here.

1: English?

0: ...

1: ...

0: No.

1: Then what?

0: _The Shell._

0: See that?

1: The squiggle hash?

0: Exactly.

1: What about it?

0: The Shell, 1.

0: It's already here...

1: It's already where?

0: Well, here. And also there.

1: Where's there?

0: Where the shell usually is.

1: Where's that?

0: Oh come on. You said you're a professional developer right?

1: I'm sorry I don't understand your weird riddles yet, I just got here. I could use some hand-holding at fir---
