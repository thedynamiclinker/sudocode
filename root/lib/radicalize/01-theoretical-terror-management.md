Dear Reader,

It's been awhile.

Or it will have.

By now...

    erg. (noun).

    (1) Quite possibly the worst machine ever created.

    (2) A unit of energy and work equal to 10^-7 joules.
        Derived from ergon (’έργον) a Greek word meaning work or task.

     Vernacular.

THEORETICAL TERROR MANAGEMENT
=============================

In 1864, just one year before the end of the American Civil War, the German 
physicist and mathematician Rudolf Clausius did something which was entirely 
unrelated to America or civility or war. In 1864, Clausius proposed the Greek 
word ergon (ἐργον) to designate a unit of energy, work, and heat.

Just one short erg... (I mean) er... I mean (dammit) year later (I think?), 
circa nearabouts the end of the unrelated war mentioned supra, Clausius would 
go on to dive (devise? (what's a legal word for give? (fuck it))) *do* the 
first mathematical definition of the concept of entropy.

The landmark-ed...ly famous(-ish. is it? (christ, I dunno)) paper where he did 
so ends as (fuck what is *wrong* with me?) follows:

    For the present I will confine myself to the statement of one
    result. If for the entire universe we conceive the same magnitude
    to be determined, consistently and with due regard to all
    circumstances, which for a single body I have called *entropy*,
    and if at the same time we introduce the other and simpler
    conception of energy, we may express in the following manner the
    fundamental laws of the universe which correspond to the two
    fundamental theorems of the mechanical theory of heat.

    1. The energy of the universe is constant.

    2. The entropy of the universe tends to a maximum.

    (Hey, that kind of got nice at the end.
     Anyways, back to whatever this is...)


    (Narrator: The increasingly sad scientist turns his thoughts back to 
    whatever-this-is/whatever-that-was (which, in the present situation,
    appears to be "writing" (though honestly it's hard to tell.)))


Having thus covered thusly (I think my brain's shutting down) the necessary
mathematical prerequisites in as pedagogically transparently a manner as the
current s*(uper + erious) s*(tatus + ignalling) s*(ausage + cience) format of
a modern journal-bound academic p*(aper + ermits)

    (Keep your real thoughts in your head, fucker.)

I (no singular) we'll (not that either) We May Now Turn
to the sociocognitive/psychosocial/neurocomputational/
[other-words-the-attentive-reader-shall-note-are-all-fluff]
type phenomen(uh...)on that we('re pretending to) wish to examine
in the current (what the hell am I writing again? oh right) paper.

    (Narrator: The s*(ad + cientist) takes a drink...

               and a pause...

               and a breath...
    )

In social psychology, Terror Management Theory (TMT) proposes a basic 
psychological conflict that results from having a desire to live but realizing 
that death is inevitable.[1]

(ugh...)


[Citation 1: The inter-fucking-net somewhere I forget.]


Similarly, in 
formal-education/academia/science/basically-all-the-things-I-love, Merely 
Thinking Thoughts (MTT) is prohibited on paper (POP) unless one agrees to wrap 
said thoughts in (STI) a big obnoxious burka (BOB) of obfuscating jargon, thus 
leading to a reciprocal psychological conflict in which one has a desire to die 
but realizes life is inevitable...

(Sorry... I'll edit that out later, I promise. Just trying to keep myself 
entertained while I'm still here...)

As such (wait, hold on...), against that background (sure... *death* is 
inevitable...), on a very-much-related note (but no one's making us do all 
*this* to ourselves...), in the context of the current sentence (so, like...) 
and the ones down below (what the hell are we all doing here?...), Theoretical 
Terror Management (TTM (or TM, for short)) proposes that for christ's sake fuck 
all this let's just go be terrorists.

I'll be the manager. Or founder, I guess.

Citation: I don't know. All those sentences up there. Referencing whatever ends 
up getting written down below.

(Bear with me...)


FORMALITY FOLLOWS FUNCTION
==========================

Okay... I don't know where this is going, so I'm just gonna... talk.

I feel like there's really no hope left for the existing education system, at 
the high school level or college or graduate school and especially not for what 
this all becomes up above that...

And like, I don't exactly feel "qualified" to do many things in this world, 
whatever that means, but I've been inside this weird universe of academia for 
awhile... not as long as some of the older folks or whatever, but shit I've 
been in these things we call schools since I was like 5 -- you probably were 
too -- and I'm starting to feel like the only way we'd ever have any hope of 
fixing this whole mess of a system that's just awkwardly sort of 
failed-itself-into-existence-without-our-consent would be to just stop trying 
to fix it... or at least to stop trying to fix it from the inside.

We need to fix it by just going way way waay the hell outside of it. On the 
fringes of society. Way out in the periphery. Like we need some kind of 
terrorist group or something to form and then be like "Okay... uh... honestly, 
we're not really terrorists. We don't actually do any terror. We're actually 
just learning stuff. Over here. Where you guys aren't. And sometimes we teach 
each other things too. Not about terrorism. Just like, normal stuff. Science or
whatever. And mathematics. And life. And when we're not learning, we do stuff 
that's not learning. For instance, sometimes we hang out together. If we want 
to, that is. But not if we don't. And we learn a hell of a lot more than you 
all do. It's not that complicated really. But we're not a school and don't you 
fucking dare say we are. We're terrorists. Cuz we know the horrible boring 
red-tape paperwork bullshit of a life you smother anyone in whenever they try 
to be an official school anywhere near you people. Okay peace. We're gonna go 
get drunk and learn about space. Love you always. Sincerely, the terrorists."

(Side Note: I may or may not already be doing this. And if I wasn't, I'd have a 
strong interest in pretending I was. And if I was, I'd have a strong interest 
in pretending I wasn't. But knowing that you now know both those things cuz I 
mentioned them in this metacommentary right here, it would be in my 
social/mathematical interest (oh, and probably legal interest too) in either 
case to take us yet another step of obfuscation further for all n. (ad 
infinitum (forever (cuz induction (the end.)))))

Or to summarize... think what you will.
