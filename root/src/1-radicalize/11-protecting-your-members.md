As a protective measure, in the interest of the group's continued 
(non-)existence, all member quotations both literal and paraphrased that might 
(/have) placed any member(s) in legal jeopardy (should their real 
identit(y/ies) happen ever to be discovered on the basis of any hints 
(un/)intentionally provided in the book) have been attributed to the group's 
founder. As such, any legal repurcussions resulting from the fictional stories 
related herein are to be directed toward said founder himself, who is alone 
responsible for all i*(llicit+mmoral) acts in the nonexistent history that 
follows, even those in which he was actually totally not involved because he 
was somewhere else at the time, probably working. And by working I mean 
crying. Cuz that's what he usually does when he isn't at Stonewall. Although 
to be fair sometime--- whatever, fuck this, you know what I mean. Just a 
routine disclaimer or whatever, you know the drill.

[Footnote -1: Honestly I wrote this part awhile ago, and like it sort of made 
sense back before everything changed, but it doesn't really fit anymore. And
I'm kinda emotionally attached to it despite its current irrelevance (which
yes, as much as I'm reluctant to admit it, is in no small part because of the
dick joke in the title). But I should probably just cut it out in the interest 
of the whole thing about "killing your darlings" or whatever (which admittedly 
sounds kinda violent but I just mean the phrase in its capacity as a metaphor 
for how you should edit your own writing ruthlessly or else it'll just 
ultimately end up being shit; like the thing that writing expert type people
always say). Anyways, whatever, forget this part. I'll probably just cut all 
this out. Plus what the hell is the point of disclaiming anything here I mean 
this is all just fiction I'm writing to procrastinate from my dissertation 
anyways, and even if it wasn't fiction at all its not like it would matter in 
the grand scheme of things anyway. So like regardless of the truth of the 
matter, either way: who fucking cares, just think whatever you want. I'm fine 
with it either way and I promise I won't be mad or whatever. Okay I'm done 
now. Sorry for the verbosity. I think the reason I yammer on like this is 
because of mathematics. Like I mean I did my old university-ish training type 
stuff in mathematics, and it was great, but as a side effect I always feel 
like I need to explain things really precisely. And precision is good and all 
but in practice (like, with prose and stuff) it just leads to me yammering on 
in circles like this and never being confident that I've actually made a point 
even long after I should have just shut the fuck up. Sorry. I'm kinda new to 
this whole writing thing. And like sure I wrote another book before this, but 
outside of the very unusual universe of writing about mathematics I basically 
have no fucking idea what I'm doing, so please forgive the occasional 
yammering. (Hah okay jesus fucking christ just shut up already. Sorry again, 
lol.) Anyways, here goes whatever comes next, I guess.]
