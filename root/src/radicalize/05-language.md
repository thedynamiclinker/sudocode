LANGUAGE
========

The definitions in the book that follows have been plagiarised from various 
dictionaries (because that's basically where they keep all the definitions so 
like what the fuck other option is there, it's not like there's a bunch of 
"free-range definitions" just running around all over the place or whatever) 
and then modified by the terrorists (us) without hesitation or attribution 
because fuck you we're terrorists and also because who can even remember which 
dictionary you got a word from there's like a billion of those goddamn things.

The resulting definitions -- spanning a wide range of topics and having been 
created in a state of total linguistic freedom -- constitute what we might call 
"free-range definitions."

There's a bunch of them running around in here.

Feel free to use them in like, life and stuff. They're ours, but they're also 
yours. Cuz freedom. Okay, end of thing.

Love and kisses,
~The terrorists.

-------------------------------

P.S. (noun) Abbreviation for "Pretentious Shit." We'll try to leave this out 
whenever possible.

-------------------------------

P.P.S. The freedom-y language-y rule-ish type things (or lack thereof) 
mentioned above also apply to like, grammar and stuff. We'll probably 
occasionally call this "syntax" instead of "grammar," which admittedly might 
sound like an instance of P.S. (see above), but really it's just cuz the word 
"grammar" reminds us of school (the old kind (the kind before terrorism)) and 
thus makes us tired, whereas the word "syntax" reminds us (or at least me) of 
like, programming and stuff, which makes we/I less tired. Negatively tired 
actually. Like, the type of thing that you enjoy and so it gives you energy. 
Plus English is just a really weird programming language anyway, and we're not 
really using it to anything like its full potential blah blah shut up self okay 
anyways let's just start writing and see how it goes.

Love and kisses (again),
~The terrorists (again).

-------------------------------

P.P.P.S. (Or: P³S) In the above sentence... like, the one where we/I said, 
"The freedom-y language-y rule-ish type things (or lack thereof) mentioned 
above also apply to like, grammar and stuff," the term "stuff" should be 
understood to be a variable whose value is (for our present purposes) equal to: 
Syntax, Semantics, Phonetics, The boundaries between languages (e.g., english 
vs schwinglish, for any value of schwinglish), The boundaries between natural 
languages and formal logics, The boundaries between natural languages and other 
symbolic systems of expressing stuff, The boundaries between letters, The 
boundaries between words, The boundaries between different orthographies, The 
boundaries between speech and sound, The boundaries between the pronunciation 
that one group of modern parochial potato people (or: P3) says is how-you're-
supposed-to-be-pronouncing-such-and-such versus all other candidate 
pronunciations (including but not limited to how people actually pronounce the 
thing for fuck's sake), and especially the boundaries between the colloquial 
and the formal. There's probably gonna be a lot of free-range versions of that 
stuff running around in here too. Not really sure how this is gonna work out. 
Either way, try not to trip. In any sense of the term.

-------------------------------

P⁴S. Almost forgot. Regarding the above-mentioned thing about stealing 
definitions from dictionaries, this whole "hey-we're-terrorists-so-we-get-to-
redo-academia-(and-civilization-(and-the-fabric-of-spacetime-(and-god-(and-
your-mom-(or-whatever)))))-all-from-scratch-cuz-we're-terrorists-so-haha-fuck-
you-but-not-really-we-just-like-talking-like-that-but-it's-not-actual-
aggression-so-don't-worry-we-love-you-anyway" thing matters a lot to us... 
like, a seriously lot... so in order to ensure that it gets to live as long as 
possible -- even if it doesn't get to live for very long -- just, in order to 
keep this alive as long as we can, we'll try our best amidst the rule-flouting 
to also be decent people. And we may fail at that sometimes, but we'll try as 
hard as we can. For example, despite the above-mentioned thing about stealing 
definitions from dictionaries (that was how this whole P⁴S deal started, 
remember?) we should probably have some system where we can say "hey, um, dear 
reader person, I got this bit from someone else so don't worry I'm not taking 
credit for it (and so on)."

However, these days the world's got this big dynamic repository of human 
knowledge, and its internal organization is always changing, which makes saying 
"hey reader here's where I got this from" kind of tricky and expiration-prone, 
even in cases where the overall set of information on [thing] is relatively 
stable. Like for example, in 10 years there are still gonna be chickens.[A]

--------

[Footnote A: There will be, I promise.[RB]]

[Recursive Footnote B: And if you happen to be a vegetarian and find the 
chicken example offensive, just replace chicken with "bread."[RRC]]

[Recursive Recursive Footnote C: And if you're offended by the word "bread" 
because it's English, just replace it with "pan."[RRRD]]

[Recursive Recursive Recursive Footnote D: And if you don't like the 
underrepresentation of undercooked materials in the last few sentences, just go 
with "dough." (In any case, it's the same principle. (Try not to be confused by 
words. (Most of the time when we get confused by words, it's probably not 
because the speaker is like, "crazy" or "dumb" or "basically just spouting 
random nonsense." (Usually in those cases we're just misunderstanding what the 
speaker is saying. (Keep that in mind. (Okay, enough silly sermon shit. Let's 
pop our way back up this stack.))))))]

--------

So, using the word chickens as a variable to refer to [whatever-your-preferred- 
example-is], here's the point. Fast forward ten years. You in the future yet? 
Okay good. See how it's pretty much the same as now, but like, later? Exactly. 
Okay, so now that it's 10 years in the future, there probably won't have been 
any overwhelming paradigm-shifting breakthroughs in our species collective 
knowledge about chickens in the previous 10 years (i.e., since now).

To a pretty good approximation, our knowledge about the odd little people we 
call chickens is gonna be the same set of information then (i.e., in the 
future) as it is now (i.e., now). However, in spite of the relatively locally 
semi-timeless-ish nature of our species' collective knowledge about 
[chicken-variable], once we find ourselves in the future, we may discover that 
all the most easy-to-find information on [chicken-variable] might not look even 
kinda similar, at least in terms of where it is, or what sentences it uses, or 
which [chicken-variable] instances are in the pictures next to the text.

The modern state of human knowledge is constant (to zeroth order) and moving 
forward quickly (to first order), but the modern organization of that knowledge 
is churning like crazy, and facts like "dear reader, here's where 
[such-and-such] is" don't stay true for very long anymore, at least for a 
sizable chunk of human knowledge, and that's true even for relatively stable 
topics like [chicken-variable].

And citing a churn-y medium like that in a more stable medium like paper is 
pretty much guaranteed to just make said paper-thing less timeless. And we like 
timeless. I mean seriously, fuck time. Time is the worst.

And so we, as responsible terrorists who love science and knowledge and 
learning and life and not-being-a-dick-to-other-good-people-by-taking-credit-
for-stuff-they-wrote-that-we-didn't-write -- in our capacity as responsible 
[that]s, we should probably figure out some way of saying -- in a medium like 
paper -- something like, "Okay here's the deal, I got this particular bit of 
information from somewhere else and it's not something I wrote or am taking 
credit for, but it may have been written by like N anonymous people 
collaboratively for some large and unknowable value of N, and it might not even 
say the same words in like a week, so just know that it's not mine except for 
the parts that are." So yeah, in our capacity as responsible terrorists, it 
would probably be nice to find a way to say that, and ideally of saying it in a 
way that doesn't inherently fuck-up our timelessness by just filling-up our 
reference sections with a bunch of invalid pointers once the information about 
[chicken-variable] (for any value of said variable) decides to shuffle itself 
around and change the sentences it uses or even just [flutter-variable] off to 
somewhere else entirely.

Not sure about the details now. We'll get there when we come to it. No need for 
the method to be super rigid or whatever. After all, if there's one thing all 
of us terrorists can agree on, it's that like... y'know... all things in 
moderation.

Love and kisses (again (again)),
~The terrorists (again (again)).
