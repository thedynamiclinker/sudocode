DIARY OF A MEMBER
=================

Stumbled upon this thing.

It's hard to be much more specific than that.

It's not quite a philosophy.

It's sort of about life. But there's also random stuff about learning..

It's definitely not a school. If it were I would run away from here and go find 
it in a second.

It... and that's really the most specific pronoun I can use here... it calls 
itself Learn Different.™

This all started when I stumbled upon a website. I was on a forum I frequent 
and someone posted a link and asked if anyone knew what this was. No one did. 
But I went to the webpage and then sort of lost track of time just... reading.

If you read through it all, the webpage claims the original source is a book.

It's not really a book book, but I found the thing they mean. The book claims 
the original source was a set of text files that were posted on some version 
control system (whatever that is) that I guess computer programmers use to keep 
track of their code or something.

And when I finally figured out what all that meant and tracked down the thing 
and got a hold of those text files and read through them, they just claim that 
the first of it appeared on the same website back where I started.

I feel like I know these people so well. But I still have no idea who started 
it or where it began.

The writing style is a bit hard to figure out.

It alternates between extreme humility and extreme bombast, and I can never be 
sure if it's more than one person writing.

If I had to put it briefly, not how they describe themselves, but just how it 
all comes together in my head it's like... okay, when you get down to it, a lot 
of the worst things people do come from the psychology of how we treat 
outgroups.

Whenever we try to make groups, they get kind of groupthink-y, and it usually 
fucks things up in some way or another. At least a little, eventually. Doesn't 
even have to be much.

But then that causes a kind of feedback, because once any kind of fuck-up is 
there, even stuff that's not all that bad, then the group's out-groups suddenly 
have something kind of embarassing to demonize the original group for -- and 
being human, they do -- or at least some members of the out-group do, again it 
doesn't have to be all that many. So out-group holds embarassing thing up to 
the flames to demonize in-group, which naturally makes the original in-group 
get more defensive, because how could you not when you feel like you're being 
attacked from the outside, and then the whole thing spirals way the fuck out of 
control.

So this group, whatever the hell it is, this thing that's sort of a school but 
insists that it isn't -- I mean they do school stuff too -- but before the 
whole school part, not like before as in the beginning of each school day, but 
before as in like logically prior -- before the school part, if you read these 
files, what they're basically doing is just clearing the ground by creating a 
group dynamic designed to hack its own group psychology out of existence and 
bond over *that*. Again, they never say that. But it's what the whole thing 
does. Here's what i mean.

How do you beat the ugliest part of human nature if you can't be a utopia or 
whatever and you can't escape human nature? Well, it's not actually that 
complicated. They fucking figured it out, lol.

It's a group built on publically shaming... themselves... and with a culture 
that places almost a cult-ish value on accepting the other. Like the most 
unacceptable others. It's so weird i still can't get it straight in my head.

See like usually groups end up growing fundamentalists, and the way a group 
fucks itself in the long term is that it's impossible to stay reasonable, 
because these fringes set up a sort of insider peer-pressure dynamic where -- 
to be a more pure group member and like signal your loyalty to each other, you 
say all the things the group was built on, but in excess. The fringes are just 
the middle with the volume way fucking up loud.

And because every group no matter what its content is is just, like, humans, 
and human nature always has that whole us/them psychology, its usually the case 
that the middle has just a normal not so bad amount of in-group out-group 
thinking, like team sports, where it's basically the same psychology as war or 
whatever but not actually hurting anyone and its just fun, cuz sports, but 
that's just the middle, and when the volume gets turned up way out at the 
extremes, you've got a dynamic where the way you signal to your buddies that 
you're a genuine group member is to be more and more volume of "us" and more 
distant from "them," not your buddies, I mean the "other" them, fuck i'm 
explaining this terribly, but like... that's normal groups right. that's not 
the point. the point is how these people sort of break all that.

It's brilliant actually.

Just build a group whose entire in-group culture is based on shaming the group 
itself in the most hyperbolic ways, while at the same time almost fetishizing 
acceptance of "the other." And the more unacceptable the others are, the more 
"culture points" or whatever you get for trying to understand where the 
outgroup people are coming from and how they're like you. I mean they don't 
track points or anything. But there's this thing called the game.

god, the game... it sounds so fucking dumb, but this game thing is literally 
changing my life.

like people go around saying certain things are liberating, no fuck off, 
nothing is as liberating as the game.

here's what you do: you just... i actually already said it... you just practice 
and develop a kind of non-sexual fetish for learning about outgroups and all 
the people you most hate... and the game is to basically come to their defense. 
not publicly necessarily. just in private, in your mind. but then after a while 
you almost cant help but to go a bit public. like youll notice yourself 
defending individuals and groups in conversations with friends... groups you 
just fucking hated like a couple weeks ago. 

And the weirdest thing about all this is that the group -- the main one. Learn 
Different™ I mean -- that's not even their thing. they're not some social 
movement about acceptance and stuff. it's like its just a basic prerequisite of 
human interaction for them. it's not what they're about. if they're anything, i 
guess theyre mostly a school. I don't know why the hell they put those two 
ideas together. Maybe it's just poor planning or something.

Anyways i've run out of stuff to read. i cant find any more.

I read through the whole damn circle of sources and got back to the start. I 
don't know where to go because these fucking people are *ghosts*. And whenever 
anyone writes anything about them, they make it sound like they all up and 
vanished a long time ago.

I'd love to find one of these things though.

i wouldnt really know how to start one of my own.

how exactly does a person even get something like this started?
