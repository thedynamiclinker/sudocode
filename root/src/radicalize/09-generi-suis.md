Assorted notes from investigation thus far.
Organize this better before going public.
-------------------------------------------

Learn Different is known for its unusual style of propaganda. The group most commonly advertises in the form of vague, hyperbolic hatespeech and offhand cryptic slogans, usually expressed in the form of grafitti, vandalism, and other minor misdemeanors. Thus far all of the group's documented acts of vandalism have been found on either condemned buildings or on property owned by the state. It is unclear at present whether this pattern is intentional, or whether it is merely a result of the fact that these are the locations in which vandalism tends to be most common.

I've been keeping a collection of the different L.D. slogans, vandalisms, and public defacements reported thus far in the course of the investigation. Here's a representative sample.


Learn Different™:
    Your shaming is our fuel.
    Your ostracism our nourishment.
    Your humiliation our lifeblood.
    We rise when you fall.

Learn Different™:
    We steal your children
    and make them love
        every
        single
        thing
        you
        hate.

Learn Different™:
    We know what you do when s/he goes out of town.

Learn Different™:
    Open the gates of hell.

Learn Different™:
    Come here, kid.
    Let's play a game.

Learn Different™:
    This crucifix is comfy.
    Wanna share mine?

Learn Different™:
    Come meet the monsters that live under your bed.

Learn Different™:
    Filth is the best brain-wash.

Learn Different™:
    The evil's coming from inside your head.

Learn Different™:
    Soaked in your tears.
    Gaming your fears.

Learn Different™:
    Give us your lonely, your tired,
    your huddled orphans and runaways
    yearning to come I mean be free,
    and exploited for stuff.

Learn Different™:
    We're only as fucked up as you are.
    You just can't see it yet.


The group is also known for its unusual style of writing in the form of bizarre half-correct definitions. For instance:


    BDSM. (noun).
    1. An abbreviation for "Binary Duality: Sound & Meaning."
    2. Other nameless activities.


In some cases, these definitions appear to be some form of propaganda. In other cases, the purpose in unclear.

It is not clear whether the group is in fact a bunch of lunatics, or just trying to sound that way. Department consensus is that the slogans were mostly likely the work of some angsty pissed-off teenagers.

In any case, the above samples constitute a representative example of the unusual habits and style often found in L.D.™ writing.

----------------------------

UPDATE:

Recently stumbled across a strange pattern.

If it holds up, dept. conclusions thus far would need to be reexamined.

The group's descriptions of itself may all be a cover.


OPEN QUESTIONS: Why do they say "Your shaming"? Why not "Your shame"?

General opinion is that the group is not particularly focused on grammar, and if it were it would likely have favored the name "Learn Differently."

Local experts are on record as saying the group likely contains no one trained in either literature or language. However, certain recently leaked samples of the group's writing show an odd amateur interest in linguistics.

Department insists that this isn't important. Need to explain this hunch better before going public.

NOTES ON EXPLANATION: Though the content varies, most common L.D. slogan is some variant of:
"Learn Different™: Your shaming is our fuel. Your ostracism our nourishment. Your humiliation our lifeblood. We rise when you fall."

Main sticking point: Humiliation and ostracism can go both ways. They can describe an act as experienced by the victim, or the act as inflicted on the victims themselves. The phrase "your ostracism" can be talking to the "you" being ostracized, or to the "you" doing the ostracizing. Same with humiliation. "Your humiliation" can be speaking to the person being humiliated or to the person doing the humiliating. Both can go both ways.

So why "your shaming"?

The majority of listeners, including myself, had always believed these slogans to be malicious. I'm coming to believe they may not be.

Note to self: Can't write this out in full yet. Need more hard evidence or else dept. will think you're just wasting their money and probably schizophrenic. Be careful with this.

----------------------------

PRIMARY OPEN QUESTION:

Since the investigation began, it has been known that a surprising number of the country's most rich and powerful individuals have suspected ties to the group. Though the group is not seriously expected by any authority to actually be involved in any form of violence or extremism, despite the playful self-identification as terrorists, the origin of the group's connections with various powerful members of business and government remains entirely mysterious.

In other words: out of nowhere we suddenly have what appears to be a group of obviously fake terrorists with no objective, engaged in no large scale criminal activities, primarily populated by teenagers and delinquents, and yet somehow in ongoing communication with at least 7 members of congress and 4 CEOs/CFOs of major corporations, all entirely sui generis, almost over night.

This much at least is agreed upon by the department, and is the primary mystery motivating the ongoing investigation into the group.

However, this most recent leak of data suggests that both the group's personal ties and its large donations all come from individuals who in recent years have been the subject of highly publicized controversies.

For the first time since I began this investigation, I think I know what those slogans mean. And if it's true, then god there's no knowing how far this has gone...

----------------------------

UPDATE:

It's all written in code. Everything they're saying is saying multiple things at once. Every last one. It's all sending two exactly opposite messages. Sometimes more. Not just the slogans. It's everything. Initial attempts to explain this to others in the dept. have proved unproductive b/c based on what they've seen they're entirely justified in thinking what I thought at first too. They're right. Given what they've seen it all looks so mundane. My god how are they even doing this... I've never seen anything like this before. Can't hope to explain it all to anyone yet because at present it's impossible to be at all confident as to what's a false positive and what's not, so the dept. will absolutely disregard this without more hard evidence. I could barely see any of it before I'd seen all of it but when the trail went cold and I ran out of leads I started rereading it and my god it was clear as day. Its like they've found some new way of hiding right out in the open, like some kind of steganography that you can't even try to decode without handing over your sanity and your soul and your confidence in everything you thought you knew but you're willing to because dammit you can see them right there hiding inside exactly the parts of a document that you fundamentally can't explain to anyone without sounding like you fit every last diagnostic criterion for a mental disorder, and so naturally as a sane human being once you see it all you can't help but wonder if maybe it's not even there after all... Maybe it is just me... Am I losing my mind?... No. Fuck. No do not say that, if you let yourself think that you're just letting them win. There may be some missing pieces but so much of it is unequivocal there's no way this could possibly all have happened by accident. Every one of my previous assumptions about L.D.'s existence and purpose and especially how long this had all been going on have, I think, been conclusively disproved by other things I found later... I've drawn it all out several times, but I keep having to scrap the old drawings and start over. Though honestly... the more I write about all this... the more I start thinking that this probably is just all in my head. I mean look at some of these things you've been writing and saying recently... This isn't you... What's happening to me?
