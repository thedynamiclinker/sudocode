<span style="display: block; text-align: center; font-style: italic;">The Book of Departure</span>

Social life is broken, both in the world of atoms (physical reality), and the world of bits (the internet).

In this book, we will sketch a rough draft of what we believe is a possible solution.

This is going to move fast, and there's a lot of information behind the links. 

Lesser minds than yours will have trouble keeping up.

But new thoughts require new words if we want to properly describe them, so here's a first attempt in that direction.

## The World of Atoms

Our mission is to create physical locations that solve [[The Big Four]] problems of modern social life.

In doing so, we aim to create the first ever locations that meet all the requirements of a [[Social Schelling Point|Strong Social Schelling Point]].

A solution to these problems is the missing ingredient that currently plagues all physical locations that claim to be a [[The Third Place|Third Place]].

Solving these problems does not require large scale changes to society.

It simply requires clearly defining an industry that the modern economy is lacking: [[The Situation Industry]], and then creating specific businesses within that industry designed to solve these problems.

We are currently working to open such locations.

## The World of Bits

The existence of the physical locations described above is a key pre-requisite that will enable us to attack a much more pernicious disease of modern life: [[The Implicit Attributes Problem]].

By using a combination of technology and the physical locations described above, we aim to perform [[Information Mining]] and storage of [[Implicit Attribute|Implicit Attributes]] in an opt-in manner, and in doing so, to create an embedding based search of a far richer set of information than can be represented in any online profile, and to do so without requiring that information to be published in natural language in any publicly visible way.

## WTF did I just read?
Sorry. That was a lot. So to say the same thing more simply: We're building physical locations where it's not awkward to meet new people, and tech that lets you find the kind of people you're looking for, using more than just pictures and some words in a profile.
