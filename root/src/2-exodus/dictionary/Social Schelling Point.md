Social Schelling Point. (noun)

A physical location specifically optimized for meeting new people.

A __Weak Social Schelling Point__ is any location that publicly declares itself to be a solution to [[The Problem of Where]]. In other words, a Weak Social Schelling point is one that publicly self-identifies as being designed for meeting new people, whether or not it actually achieves that goal in any measurable way.

A __Strong Social Schelling Point__ is any location that additionally solves [[The Big Four]] problems of modern social life. Doing so requires, among other things, solving [[The Problem of When]], by explicitly prohibiting participation of, or implicitly disincentivising participation by, individuals who are not currently open to meeting new people at that moment. In addition, such locations must also solve [[The Problem of Who]] and [[The Problem of How]].

A Strong Social Schelling Point solves the problem of _where_ to meet new people, and guarantees or strongly suggests that everyone inside is currently open to doing so _when_ they are in that location.

Further, it provides a built-in solution to the problem of _who_ you would most like to talk to in that location, and _how_ to open a conversation with them.

Most importantly, it does so without requiring the participants to understand any of the details above.

No Strong Social Schelling Points appear to exist, at present.

However, any locations of this form, if it were possible to create them, would automatically possess a large quantity of socially desirable properties.

For example, any person X in a Strong Social Schelling Point can be confident that any other person Y in the same location is open to meeting new people, because all individuals present in that location entered it with full knowledge of that location's purpose, or were made aware of its purpose immediately after entering.

As such, any person X in a Strong Social Schelling Point can be confident, even before talking to any other person Y, that Y will not be bothered or annoyed if X approaches and initiates a conversation.

This knowledge does not require X and Y to communicate, it is implied by their shared presence in the location.

More simply: that's why they're both there.

This concept is a specific case of the concept of a [Schelling Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)) in game theory.

However, to reiterate, no Strong Social Schelling Points appear to exist, at present.

The lack of such locations will be referred to as [[The Social Schelling Point Problem]].
