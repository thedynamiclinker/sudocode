A network of N people, where everyone knows everyone else.

Draw N dots.

Each dot is a person.

Then draw an edge between all possible pairs of those dots.

Each edge represents the fact that those two people know each other.

Exactly.

Like that.

That's a complete graph of order N, and it's the shape of social network that basically everyone lived their entire lives in throughout all of human history, until like, a few years ago.

This may be causing some problems at the moment.

For an unnecessary amount of extra mathematical details about this totally simple concept, go somewhere else.

For the opposite of a complete graph, see the [[Asshole Topology]].
