In any network of nodes connected by edges, the Betti Number is the number of edges you need to cut in order to split the network into two disconnected components.

For an example of a network with minimal Betti Number, see [[Asshole Topology]].
For an example of a network with maximal Betti Number, see [[Complete Graph]].
