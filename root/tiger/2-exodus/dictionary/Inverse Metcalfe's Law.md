## Metcalfe's Law

The familiar Metcalfe's Law states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of users. This means that as more people join a network, its value increases exponentially.

The term "value" in Metcalfe's Law is undefined. Further, it claims the value is a function of the number of nodes, rather than a more important property of a network: its density of edges.

We propose the following inverse of the traditional Metcalfe's Law.

## Inverse Metcalfe's Law

The amount of hate that the users of a platform claim to possess for that platform is inversely proportional to the density of edges of the social graphs that the platform brings into existence.

The maximum level of "how much your users hate you" therefore occurs for apps such as Tinder and LinkedIn, while the minimum user-hate occurs for apps that build a complete graph of order N, where N is the number of edges.

No apps in the latter category are known to exist, even approximately.
