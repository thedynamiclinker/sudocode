## Definition

An implicit attribute is any truth about you that is not explicitly stated in any of your online profiles, nor directly observable from your physical appearance.

In other words, an implicit attribute is any truth about you that is not publicly available.

Nearly all truths about all people are implicit attributes.

Your height is not an implicit attribute.

Your skin color is not an implicit attribute.

Your sex is not an implicit attribute, at least probably.

Nothing you put on your T.\*r profile or your L.\*n is an implicit attribute.

Implicit attributes are all the other truths about you, except what is currently available to the public.

They're no less true than the public facts you've made available online or in person.

The difference is they're not searchable, so all the people looking for someone like you by searching every existing app on these dimensions cannot find you.

Making these attributes searchable without making them public is one of the fundamental problems of modern society we aim to solve.
