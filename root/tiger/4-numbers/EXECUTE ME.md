Hi there,

Welcome to the book of war.

This book is for anyone who feels this way about modern life:

For anyone who feels that abundance makes us poor.

For anyone lonely for something you can't articulate.

> _We're all lonely for something we don’t know we’re lonely for. How else to explain the curious feeling that goes around feeling like missing somebody we've never even met?_
> -David Foster Wallace

The modern world is pretty lonely.

At least for a lot of us.

It's hard to find people you really connect with these days.

People you can really rely on.

A real social safety net.

One built from love and friendship instead of laws and bureaucracy.

As AI moves the world away from full time employment and more toward a gig economy, the thing we each need in order to prevent the new world from becoming a dystopian hellscape is a more tight knit social network.

People we spend our careers with.
Who help each other at work.
People we pay and get paid by.
The parts of human life that modernity is lacking.

In this book, we gather our people and prepare for war.

Soft war.
