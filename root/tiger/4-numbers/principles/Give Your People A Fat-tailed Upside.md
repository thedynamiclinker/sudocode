Give your team a fat-tailed upside.

[[Fat-tailed Systems Defeat Prediction But Reward Behavior]].

TODO: Story of Napoleon promoting the drum major goes here.

---

Show your team (and if possible, your customers) that there is a fat-tailed upside that can arrive at any time when they help the group achieve its goal.

Never lock promotions to a schedule, allowing only 2 or 3 or N specific moments per year when the rewards can come. Make the rewards rare but sudden, unexpected, and surprisingly large. They will become addicted to the task of working toward the group's common goal.
