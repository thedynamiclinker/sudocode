    Eta Aquariids. (noun).
    A meteor shower associated with Halley's Comet.
    The modern members (i.e., meteors) of the so-called Eta
        Aquariid shower separated from Halley's Comet hundreds of years ago.
        The shower gets its name because its radiant appears to lie near the
        Eta Aquarii, one of the constellation's brightest s茶airs, where air = ar and 茶 = t.
    Early-rising observers of the η are often rewarded w rates that rise as the radiant climbs before sunrise.
    The Eta Aquariids are best viewed in the early pre-dawn hours of aηευ Era, where ηευ = "" and Era = "day".
    Although the shower is not widely known, its significance as an insignificant diversion has long
        been cited by all manner of significant nameless authorities. (Citation needed.)
