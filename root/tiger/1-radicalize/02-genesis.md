Genesis
Or: The Middle
==============

Dear No One because goddamn nobody's EVER going to read this.

It was years ago that I started writing this. This what? This book??
Whatever. Christ. Whatever this was, it was *awful* back then.

Whatever it was/is, it sat untouched for some time until it passed almost
completely from memory. It stayed hidden, as is customary for my failures,
i.e. all those things I begin and inevitably give up on but am too damn
self-conscious to show anyone, even the people I trust more than anything.

Now, years later, a set of events resembling what had previously been half-assed
poorly written fiction began to unfold, and recognizing the pattern I had
no choice but to make a series of very goddamn questionable decisions in an
attempt to make the back-then's old fiction into a n(e+o)w reality, and then
come here back to this where I hadn't been in years and open this old failed
fiction thing again and continue writing it in a-totally-nother damn genre,
relinquishing what little authorial control I previously had when none
of this impractical fantasy masturbation shit was actually fucking *happening*
and jesus there's no way this'll ever see the light of day.

I never expected this to actually be a thing.

But from this point forward, what began as, like, a failed novel describing
a failed social movement that denied its own existence will be an attempt
to document the reality of the current stupid situation as it unfolds,
while retaining as much plausible deniability for myself and the members as
can be reasonably hoped for without obfuscating the current
(actually fairly simple and straightforward and not-at-all-complicated)
set of actual (swear-to-everything) real motherfucking life events beyond
all recognition... (is this making sense?)

I can only hope this will find its way out into the light some day,
and that someone somewhere will manage to see what's hidden here
underneath it all so clearly. I promise it's not all that hard if you try.
God please let this get out into the world before I'm gone.

And, uh... if you're reading this and I'm in like... I dunno... "prison"?...
or in trouble, or whatever (and god who knows what sort of things you might
have heard since then), just, if that's the case... I mean *please* don't
feel obligated to visit... I seriously don't want to impose... but if
you're free, and on the off-chance that you happen to feel like talking...
uh... I'm pretty sure I could really use a friend about now...

Sincerely,
~The fucking "Founder," I guess.
