A busybox style suite of tools providing repls on various cultures throughout mathematics and computing that did not previous support interactive development. Provides one command per culture listed below, each a single character greek letter.

# The /etc/groups

## α: Algebra

TODO: Give 1 a repl on group theory, ring theory, and field theory. Give examples and do one simple proof.

## β: Unassigned

echo "It's not polite to call a group the betas."

## γ: Geometry

TODO: Differential Geometry repl. 1 learns how tensors and covariant derivatives work.

## δ: Calculus


## ε: Analysis

0 says this mostly doesn't execute.
1 says wait I thought this was just rigorous calculus.
0 says it is.
1 says well there were all sorts of computations up there!
0 says yeah but not down here.
1 says do they realize they broke it?
0 says broke what?
1 says the field they forked and made worse?

## ζ: Number theory
 

## η: The Catedral

"How do I draw those diagrams in a repl?"

## θ: Topology and Homotopy


## ι: Hardware

HDL from Nissan & Shocken.

## κ: Kernel

BPF?

## λ: The lambdas

Easy!

## Λ: The Big Lambda

We'll have done this in lost+found.

## μ: The mus

Actually exists lol.

## ν: Artificial Intelligence
Also exists.

## νega: Finance
This is just the money app.


## Ξ: ???

The @ command with @(){} and pipes!

Here we learn the writing is due to The Authors.

They come down from kernel space and show us how to use the @ syntax.

## ο: The little omicrons

No.

## Ο: The big Omicrons

Hmm...

## Π: The Pis


## Ϻ: The Misunderstood (The Sans)
The Constructivists!

The only field that automatically generates code from proofs.

1 is instantly radicalized and converted.


## Ϙ: ???


## ρ: "The Rows"

No thank you.

## Σ: Reverse Mathematics

Start with BW iff ACA0 and try to see what a repl would be.

## τ: Topos Theory


## Υ / υ: The Fork


## φ: Physics

Do some basic quantum stuff for spin ½, there's already probably a repl for this.

## χ: Statistics and probability

Do Jaynes.


## ψ: Scientific computing

These guys don't know how to do anything outside a repl. No need to explain.

## ω: The little omegas

Set Theory

Model theory

Proof theory.

## Ω: The Big Omegas

Large Cardinals.

The ultimate repl.

Likely impossible.

Make an attempt.
