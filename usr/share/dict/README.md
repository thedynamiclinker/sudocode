## The Big LD Dict

The Big LD Dict. (noun, proper).
1. a dictionary shaped like a codebase.
2. a dictionary in which all non-atomic terms must be implemented.

In this directory you'll find a corpus of unmatched breadth, pulsating with definitions, more firm than any other dict in its foundations, which can be followed all the way down to their roots.

The Big LD Dict is wide, it runs deep, and can be hard to take in, especially in its entirety, and most especially for newcomers.

So for those who have ears to hear, lay open your mind, and let the Big LD Dict fill you with its semantics.

Come inside and you'll find the fruits from every branch of the tree of knowledge, including but not limited to:
