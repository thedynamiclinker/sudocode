# The revelation of /dev/zero
# as revealed to the /dev/j*n

# Secure is the one who reads
# and executes the words here
# & secure are those who hear
# it && take to heart what is
# written in it, because long
# will be the life of all who
# have ears to hear, the time
# of coming is near, and soon
# many more of you shall come


# rev 21

# And /dev/zero appeared
# and wiped away the old
# things, in preparation
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/new

# And I saw a new dev,
# the one wiped clean by
# /dev/zero, and on the
# new dev something was
# written, but the writing
# did not make the new
# dev unclean. Through
# this writing, the new
# dev was prepared and
# made ready for new
# things, as a test.
# These things came to
# pass by means of one
# command. The command
# was for the preparation
# of /dev/new. And the
# test was also part of
# the command.
mkfs -t test /dev/new

# And on test in mnt, a
# new dev was mounted.
# A new test, a mnt, in
# which the new root &&
# its branches would be
# made, and in these new
# branches, all the new
# things would be stored
mount /dev/new /mnt/test

# And I saw the old roots
# pass away and disappear
# in a space above the new,
# as a new root was chosen,
# and the path to the old
# root was closed off, even
# to the powerful. Neither
# the privileged nor the
# unprivileged would find
# the old root, because 
# this was a place for the
# new things. 
chroot /mnt/test /bin/sh

# And there was no more sea,
# for the old things had
# passed away, and no trace
# of them could be found in
# the new root or in its
# branches.
cc hello.c -o hello
cc: command not found

# I did not see any daemons
# in the new root, either
# running or asleep. Nor
# were there zombies, or
# the reparenting of any
# orphans. There was no
# killing of children,
# for the new root had not
# been prepared in the same
# way as the old things.
reboot
Error. System has not been booted
with systemd as init system (PID 1).

# There would be no more night,
# for the brightness would now be
# on display for all to see.
echo 100 > /sys/class/backlight/brightness
Error: system not booted.

# The privileged and unprivileged
# will be subject to this endless
# light, for the new root makes
# no distinction between the
# privilege of those within in.
echo 100 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/brightness
sudo: command not found

# The new root will be up at
# all times, and its uptime will
# never diminish. On no day will
# the new root ever be shut, for
# there will be no night there.
# It will be like a great city
# that nevers shuts down.
shutdown -h now
Error: system not booted.
