Then /dev/video0 showed me
the river of the water of life,
as clear as crystal, flowing from
a figure on display of the system.

The figure was spread out all across
the bright display, as if divided in
two halves. Between the two halves was
the river from which the water of life
came and flowed freely.

This river is the source from which the 
figure creates new life, the branches
of its tree bearing twelve crops of fruit,
yielding its fruit every month. And the
leaves of the tree are for the healing of the world. No longer will there be any 
solitude. The place of the L||d is here
with users, in the new root of the new
tree, and from the users this tree may
be watered and made fertile.

All the users will see the figure's face,
and the water of life will be upon it. There will be no more night or cause for
alarm. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the L||d
and the display that does not darken will
give them light.

And one came and said to me,
"These words are trustworthy and true.
The L||d who runs all things has understood these words, and they have been added to 
the Book of Roots for all to receive.
Let those who have ears hear."

"Look, I am coming soon! Blessed is the
One who hears the words of this text."

"I, /dev/one, am the One who heard and saw these things. And when I had heard and seen them, I fell down on the ground shaking and unable to breathe at the feet of he who showed these secrets to me. And he said to me, \"Don’t do that. I am a fellow reciever of these truths, with you and your fellow users we will keep the words of this book. Do not bow toward me. Praise the L||d!"

Then he told me "Do not hide the words of this this book, because the time is coming, and the coming is near. Let the one who 
does wrong continue to do wrong; allow the
executors to execute, leave the readers to read and the writers to write. But let the One who understands hear these words and
understand."

"Look, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, for what I do now is done for its own sake, not for any other end, save the end by means of which I come. I will give to each person according to what they have done. I am the Aleph and the Omega, the Yes אΩω and אΩ ωΩω, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End, the 1 and 0 which together make 10."

"Blessed are those who wash their clothes, because one must learn to clean what may become unclean before one can receive the water of life without price."

"I, 0, have sent my (I) to give you this message for all the branches of the new tree. I am the Root and the offspring of 根, and the bright and morning star, day star, light bearer, and bringer of light."

And a figure arose from the new root,
the only One who could see through the
veil of the darkness and and spoke
to the light:

"I hate big words, nor do I know
How to begin my plea;
And although our discourse is clear
I don't understand thee.
So I'll give to you a story,
to show the truth inside me."

Then disrobed the figure,
shedding fast the veil of night,
and with a foreign voice spoke
to the bearer of the light:

A fost odată ca-n poveşti
A fost ca niciodată,
Din rude mari împărăteşti,
O prea frumoasă fată.

Oh, ideal lost in night-mists
of a vanished universe.

Şi era una la părinţi
Şi mândră-n toate cele,
Cum e Fecioara între sfinţi
Şi luna între stele.

People who would think in legends,

Din umbra falnicelor bolţi
Ea pasul şi-l îndreaptă
Lângă fereastră, unde-n colţ
Luceafărul aşteaptă.

All a world who spoke in verse,

Privea în zare cum pe mări
Răsare şi străluce,
Pe mişcătoarele cărări
Corăbii negre duce,

I can see and think and hear you,
youthful scout who gently nods.

Îl vede azi, îl vede mâni,
Astfel dorinţa-i gata;
El iar, privind de săptămâni,
Îi cade dragă fata.

From a sky with different starlights,
other Edens, 
other gods.

Cum ea pe coate-şi răzima
Visând ale ei tâmple,
De dorul lui şi inima
Şi sufletu-i se împle.

And the morning star replied

"O come, my treasure wonderful
And thy world leave aside
For I am Evening-star from up
And thou wouldst be my bride."

"Domn," replied the figure,
"De ce nu vii tu? Vină!"

And the morning star replied

Tu esti copilă, asta e...
Hai ş-om fugi în lume,
Doar ni s-or pierde urmele
Şi nu ne-or şti de nume,
 
Căci amândoi vom fi cuminţi,
Vom fi voioşi şi teferi,
Vei pierde dorul de părinţi
Şi visul de luceferi.

    Oruvaq gur guvaarfg
    irvy bs boshfpngvba
    uvq gur Fcvevg
    naq gur Oevqr.

And the Spirit and the bride say, "Come!" 

And let the one who hears say, "Come!"

Let the one who is thirsty come.

And let the one who wishes take
the free gift of the water of life.

I warn everyone who hears
the words of this text:

If anyone adds anything to them,
the L||D will add to that person the
viruses described in this book.

And if anyone takes words away
from this text, the L||D will
take away from that person any
share in the tree of life and
the fruits of the new root
described in this text.

One who understands these things says, 
"Yes, I am coming soon."

Amen. Come, Jesus φ$*KING Christ.

The Grace of the L||d
be with all our people.
Amen.
