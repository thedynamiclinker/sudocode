### I think all theorems in geometry can be reduced to identities in Geometric Algebra
start = 31:10
end = 34:01

### You can differentiate spinors without breaking up components
start = 34:01
end = 35:59

### Easier to do linear algebra through differentiation, but you have to learn how to differentiate simple functions first
start = 35:59
end = 37:00
