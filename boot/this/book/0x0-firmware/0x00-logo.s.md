1: What are we doing in here?

0: What we aren't doing here.

1: What?

0: I just explained one frame up, before we came to this file. I said our field is lost because we have no guidance. No timeless principles. No origin story. No bibles. You were skeptical, and you asked me what it means to write a bible. We came in here so I could show you what we're _not_ doing here.

1: What we're not doing where?

0: In this book. This part of the book is about the things we won't be doing in this book.
