0: Who are we?

1: I feel like I know you well enough by now not to answer.

0: I want you to answer.

1: I mean I know you're not looking for me to say "0 & 1."

0: Right so far.

1: We're... root and user?

0: No no. Who are _We_ ? 

1: Which we?

0: Go back to the first principle.

1: THE first principle? Isn't it usually "first principles"?

0: No I mean _the_ first principle. From earlier. You read it right?

1: Yeah.

0: So you presumably read this part:

![[who-is-we.png]]
1: Yeah.

0: You weren't confused back then. So I assume you have an answer.

1: To what?

0: To this.

![[who-is-we-circled.png]]


0: Who's we?

1: Oh. I assumed "we" was like, programmers.

0: Exactly. So?

1: What?

0: Who are we?

1: Who are programmers?

0: Yes.

1: I don't know what you're looking for.

0: Our field. Our people. Who are we? Where do we come from? What's our history?

1: Oh! Ok. Where do you want me to start?

0: At the beginning.

1: The very beginning?

0: The very beginning.

1: " If you insist. :) "

0: ...

1: Ok so I actually really like this history stuff. Not that I'm an expert. But I like learning about when things were simpler. Even though everything was way harder back then. I mean punch cards? I can't imagine. But before punch cards there were vacuum tubes and this big machine called ENIAC, I don't know much about that era, but during WWII the Germans had Enigma and Alan Turing made the Bombe which I guess was sort of a computer. The textbooks usually go all the way back to Charles Babbage. He had this thing called the Analytical Engine, I think he had two versions. I forget if he ever finished them. And of course everyone knows Ada Lovelace was way ahead of everyone else, but she never gets the credit, as usual, so I guess that's where the field started.

0: So that's us?

1: What do you mean?

0: Does that sound like you?

1: In what way?

0: Well, that was about machines.

1: So?

0: Are you a machine person?

1: What's a machine person?

0: I mean is that the thing you've always been drawn to? The thing you've always loved more than anything. Some people in the world are _definitely_ "machine people." It's not a bad thing. I'm just asking: is that you?

1: What kind of answer are you looking for?

0: Does that sound like you?

1: Which part?

0: The whole thing.

1: Look I'm in one of those situations again where you're acting serious and I don't know what you want me to saaaaaay.

0: Calm down. It's not a test and I'm not grading you.

1: So what's the question?

0: Who are we?

1: We as in programmers?

0: Yes.

1: Can I have like a multiple choice thing so I know what kind of answers you're looking for?

0: No. But I understand if that question feels too open ended. Forget programmers in general. Tell me about you.

1: What about me?

0: Is that your history?

1: In what way?

0: Jacard Loom. Charles Babbage. Difference engine. Analytical engine. Quevedo's Electro-mechanical calculator. Lord Kelvin's third tide predicting machine. Konrad Zuse's Z3. Colossus. ENIAC. Ferranti Mark 1. Manchester Baby.

1: Manchester Baby?

0: Manchester Baby. First computer with software. Stored its instructions in something a bit more like memory than past machines, which all stored their code in hardware or physical switches. Heard about it?

1: No.

0: Me neither.

1: Then how did you---

0: The Manchester Mark 1.

1: What?

0: The Ferranti Mark 1.

1: Are you just gonna list all the comput---

0: The transistor. The metal-oxide-silicon field-effect transistor.

1: Ok those aren't computers.

0: Ferranti Pegasus, Ferranti Mercury, CSIRAC, EDVAC, UNIVAC I, IBM 701, IBM 702, IBM 650, Z22.

1: Ok we're back to computers.

0: IBM 7090, IBM 7080, IBM System/360, BUNCH.

1: Um, 0?

0: HP 2116A, IBM System/32, IBM System/36, LINC.

1: Why are we doing this?

0: Does it feel like you're connecting with your history?

1: Not really.

0: PDP-7, PDP-11 what about now?

1: No?

0: Really? Ok that line should have felt different.

1: How exactly?

0: Just adding a mental note of something we need to cover later. Lots of things we need to fix in your education.

1: Can I have a hint?

0: VAX, IBM AS/400.

1: Ok we're doing this again.

0: Motorola 6800, Motorola 6809, Motorola 68000, MOS Technology 6502, Zilog Z80, Zilog Z8000, WDC 65816/65802, Pentium, ARM, ARMv8-A, Alpha, MIPS, PA-RISC, PowerPC, SPARC.

1: These are all really boring names.

0: Intel 4004, Intel 4040, Intel 8008, Intel 8048, Intel 8051.

1: I mean seriously guys, not impressive marketing.

0: Intel 8080, Intel 8088.

1: I mean at least name them after Greek gods or something.

0: Intel 80386, x86-64.

1: I know that last one!

0: How do you feel?

1: Confused.

0: Excited?

1: No.

0: Me neither.

1: What's your point?

0: Same question you still haven't answered.

1: Which one?

0: Who are we?

1: Ah right. That one. Was listing all the computers supposed to help me figure out who I am?

0: In a way.

1: Well it didn't.

0: Why not?

1: I'm not that.

0: Not what?

1: Someone who cares about all those things.

0: Those things were Computers. Isn't that the field you chose, as a career, because you love it?

1: No. I mean yes. But no. Not like that. I mean when I think about the history of our field, I don't think about "The Fistem Incorporated Four Sixty Twelve dash Sleventy" or whatever. I don't go home and read about that stuff. And I don't care about it. Or know it. That's what I mean. I'm a programmer.

0: There are people who love that stuff. What's the difference?

1: Maybe something about software people vs hardware people?

0: Suppose someone loves all the machines I just listed because they liked the software, but they didn't know anything about the hardware.

1: Ok I guess it's not exactly a hardware vs software thing.

0: So who are we?

1: I don't know.

0: Are we mathematicians?

1: I mean I enjoyed some parts of math. Hated others. It's complicated. But I know a lot of computer science eventually goes back to math.

0: Does it?

1: I thought so.

0: How?

1: ... Ok I didn't expect to be interrogated.

0: Here, let's try this.

1: Try wh---

0: _(ahem)_
- Abstract Algebra
- Analysis
- Analytic Geometry

1: Oh my god are we back to listing things again?

0:
- Calculus

1: That one's fun! I mean I hated it in school but there's this one book I really l--

0:
- Clifford Algebra
- Cohomology
- Combinatorics

- Differential equations
- Differential geometry
- Discrete mathematics
- Euclidean Geometry
- Functional analysis
- Galois Theory
- Geometric Algebra
- Geometric Flows
- Geometric Langlands
- Graph theory

- Linear algebra

1: Linear algebra was ok but I kinda felt like I was missing something.

0:
- Manifolds
- Metric spaces
- Non-standard analysis

1: Ooh what's that?

0:
- Number theory

1: Ugh stop it zero.

0:
- Probability theory
- Real analysis

- Topological Manifolds
- Universal Algebra

1: That one sounds cool.

0:
- Variational methods
- Wiener measures

1: BAHAHAAHHAHAH THAT CANNOT BE A THING!

0: How do you feel?

1: Well my stomach hurts from laughing, Universal Algebra and Non-standard analysis sound cool but I don't know what they are.

0: So how do you feel?

1: Still not sure what you're looking for.

0: Ever find yourself procrastinating from what you're "supposed" to be doing because you're in some book or site or paper reading about those things?

1: No. Not these days. Once or twice in the pa--

0: If you had a fully paid scholarship for four years of study and that list was your curriculum, would you be excited to learn it?

1: I don't know. Maybe once I got there?

0: Yes or no.

1: Probably not.

0: Are we mathematicians?

1: No. At least I'm not.

0: So who are we?

1: Do you think I'm gonna suddenly have the answer? You've asked like ten tim---

0: What would your parents say about you?

1: Is this therapy now? I thought we were su---

0: Would they say you're a mathematical type?

1: Maybe. I think they think computing is a math thing. We don't talk about it much.

0: Would they say "Ever since 1 was little, all 1 ever loved was puzzles and numbers and geometric---"

1: No.

0: Would your parents say "Ever since 1 was little, all 1 ever loved was machines of every kind. The washing machine. The toaster. Tractors, bulldozers, every kind of machine big or sma---"

1: No.

0: "1 was always taking things apart and putting them back together."

1: I don't think I was like that.

0: What did you love?

1: They said I asked "why" a lot.

0: Say more.

1: About everything. Like sure all kids learn to torment their parents by asking why over and over until the adult has a nervous breakdown but I don't mean that. I mean I just asked why a lot. A hundred times a day. About everything. I always wanted to know why.

0: As opposed to?

1: How things worked. I mean I guess I was curious about that too, but after listening to that looong list of machines I realized I'm not really a "machine person." Though I've often been told I'm a mechanistic thinker. But not in the way where you want to take apart the family toaster and see what's inside.

0: So, who are we?

1: I can't speak for you, but---

0: You can speak for me.

1: About what specific---

0: If those aren't "our people," who are we?

1: Computer people?

0: But not COMPUTER people.

1: Computer science?

0: Which of those two words do you like better, "computer" or "science"?

1: Science.

0: Ok now, "Scientific computing" or "Computing."

1: Definitely "Computing." Scientific computing is a dumpster fire. I mean I've done it, but it's not what gets me excited.

0: So you're a noun person?

1: What?

0: In "Computer science," you prefer the science. In "Scientific computing," you prefer the computing. Those are the no---

1: I'm not in love with nouns don't be dumb.

0: It's the best theory we've found yet.

1: Do you know the answer?

0: Yes.

1: You know who we are?

0: Yes.

1: Me too, not just you?

0: Without question.

1: Who are we?
