0: Who are we?

1: I feel like I know you well enough by now not to answer.

0: I want you to answer.

1: I mean I know you're not looking for me to say "0 & 1."

0: Right so far.

1: We're... root and user?

0: No no. Who are _We_ ? 

1: Which we?

0: We just got done writing the first principle.

1: Right, I read it. Finish Hello World.

0: So you presumably read this part:

![[who-is-we.png]]
1: Yeah.

0: You weren't confused back then. So I assume you have an answer.

1: To what?

0: To this.

![[who-is-we-circled.png]]


0: Who's we?

1: Oh. I assumed "we" was like, programmers.

0: Exactly. So?

1: What?

0: Who are we?

1: Who are programmers?

0: Yes.

1: I don't know what you're looking for.

0: Our field. Our people. Who are we? Where do we come from? What's our history?

1: Oh! Ok. Where do you want me to start?

0: At the beginning.

1: The very beginning?

0: The very beginning.

1: " If you insist. :) "

0: ...

1: Ok so I actually really like this history stuff. Not that I'm an expert. But I like learning about when things were simpler. Even though everything was also a lot harder back then. I mean punch cards? I can't imagine. But before punch cards there were vacuum tubes and this big machine called ENIAC, I don't know much about that era, but during WWII the Germans had Enigma and Alan Turing made the Bombe which I guess was sort of a computer. The textbooks usually go all the way back to Charles Babbage. He had this thing called the Analytical Engine, I think he had two versions. I forget if he ever finished them. I think he ran out of money or something. And of course everyone knows Ada Lovelace was way ahead of everyone else, but she never gets the credit, as usual, so I guess that's where the field started.

0: So that's us?

1: What do you mean?

0: Does that sound like you?

1: In what way?

0: Well, that was about machines.

1: Is that wrong?

0: No.

1: Good. Because it seemed like you were---

0: Might be wrong. It's not up to me to say. I'm asking you.

1: Asking me what?

0: Does that sound like you?

1: Which part?

0: The whole thing.

1: Look I'm in one of those situations again where you're acting serious and I don't know what you want me to saaaaaay.

0: Calm down. It's not a test and I'm not grading you.

1: So what's the question?

0: Who are we?

1: We as in programmers?

0: Yes.

1: Can I have like a multiple choice thing so I know what kind of answers you're looking for?

0: No. But I understand if that question feels too open ended. Forget programmers in general. Tell me about you.

1: What about me?

0: Is that your history?

1: In what way?

0: Jacard Loom. Babbage's Difference engine. Babbage's Analytical engine. Quevedo's Electro-mechanical calculator. Lord Kelvin's third tide predicting machine. Konrad Zuse's Z3. Colossus. ENIAC. Ferranti Mark 1. Manchester Baby.

1: Manchester Baby?

0: Manchester Baby. First computer with software. Stored its instructions in its memory instead of in hardware or physical switches. Heard about it?

1: No.

0: Me neither.

1: Then how did you---

0: The Manchester Mark 1. The Ferranti Mark 1.

1: Are you just gonna list all the comput---

0: The transistor. The metal-oxide-silicon field-effect transistor.

1: Ok those aren't computers.

0: Ferranti Pegasus, Ferranti Mercury, CSIRAC, EDVAC, UNIVAC I, IBM 701, IBM 702, IBM 650, Z22.

1: Ok we're back to computers.

0: IBM 7090, IBM 7080, IBM System/360, BUNCH.

1: Um, 0?

0: HP 2116A, IBM System/32, IBM System/36, LINC.

1: Why are we doing this?

0: Does it feel like you're connecting with your history?

1: Not really.

0: PDP-7, PDP-11 what about now?

1: No?

0: Really? Ok that should have changed then.

1: How exactly?

0: Just adding a mental todo item. Something we'll need to fix in your education.

1: Can I have a hint?

0: VAX, IBM AS/400.

1: Ok we're doing this again.

0: Motorola 6800, Motorola 6809, Motorola 68000, MOS Technology 6502, Zilog Z80, Zilog Z8000, WDC 65816/65802, Pentium, ARM, ARMv8-A, Alpha, MIPS, PA-RISC, PowerPC, SPARC.

1: These are all really boring names.

0: Intel 4004, Intel 4040, Intel 8008, Intel 8048, Intel 8051.

1: I mean seriously guys, not impressive marketing.

0: Intel 8080, Intel 8088.

1: I mean at least name them after Greek gods or something.

0: Intel 80386, x86-64.

1: I know that last one.

0: How do you feel?

1: Confused.

0: Excited?

1: No.

0: Me neither.

1: What's your point?

0: Same question you still haven't answered.

1: Which one?

0: Who are we?

1: Ah right. That one. Was listing all the computers supposed to help me figure out who I am?

0: In a way.

1: Well it didn't.

0: Why not?

1: I'm not that.

0: Not what?

1: Someone who cares about all those things.

0: Those things were Computers. Isn't that the field you chose, as a career, because you love it?

1: No. I mean yes. But no, not like that. I mean when I think about the history of our field, I don't think about "The Fistem Incorporated Four Sixty Twelve dash Sleventy" or whatever. I don't go home and read about that stuff. And I don't care about it. Or know it. That's what I mean. I'm a programmer.

0: There are people who love that stuff. What's the difference?

1: Maybe something about software people vs hardware people?

0: Suppose someone loves all the machines I just listed because they liked the software, but they didn't know anything about the hardware.

1: Ok I guess it's not exactly a hardware vs software thing.

0: So who are we?

1: Do you think I'm gonna suddenly have the answer? You've asked like twelve tim---

0: Are we "machine people"?

1: Machine people...

0: Would your parents say "Ever since 1 was little, all 1 ever loved was machines of every kind. The washing machine. The toaster. Tractors, bulldozers, every kind of machine big or small."

1: No.

0: "1 was always taking things apart and putting them back together."

1: I don't think I was like that.

0: What did you love?

1: They said I asked "why" a lot.

0: Say more.

1: About everything. Like sure all kids learn to torment their parents by asking why over and over until the adult has a nervous breakdown but I don't mean that. I mean I just asked why a lot. A hundred times a day. About everything. I always wanted to know why.

0: As opposed to?

1: How things worked. I mean I guess I was curious about that too, but after listening to that looong list of machines I realized I'm not really a "machine person." Though I've often been told I'm a mechanistic thinker. But not in the way where you want to take apart the family toaster and see what's inside.

0: So, who are we?

1: I can't speak for you, but---

0: You can speak for me.

1: About what specific---

0: If those aren't "our people," who are we?

1: Computer people?

0: But not COMPUTER people.

1: Computer science?

0: Which of those two words do you like better, "computer" or "science"?

1: Science.

0: Ok now, "Scientific computing" or "Computing."

1: Definitely "Computing." Scientific computing is a dumpster fire. I mean I've done it, but it's not what gets me excited.

0: So you're a noun person?

1: What?

0: In "Computer science," you prefer the science. In "Scientific computing," you prefer the computing.

1: I'm not in love with nouns don't be dumb.

0: It's the best theory we've found yet.

1: Do you know the answer?

0: Yes.

1: You know who we are?

0: Yes.

1: Me too, not just you?

0: Without question.

1: Who are we?

0: Not just us.

1: What?

0: Our people. A lot of them are lost.

1: Who is "our people"?

0: Not one of us in a hundred knows our roots. But we're everywhere.

1: What's our roots?

0: Some of us are in math departments. But we're not mathematicians.

1: I have mixed feelings about math.

0: Some of us chose physics and spent as many years in academia as we could, before leaving with a masters or PhD.

1: I always wanted to learn how that quantum stuff works, ooh and relativ---

0: Some of us are in neuroscience or cognitive psychology. These days, a lot of us ended up in machine learning of AI.

1: Omg have you used @2 yet it's incredi---

0: Most of us have found computing in some way or another.

1: Sometimes I feel like I'm just talking to myself here. Hhellooooo I'm 1 is anyone listeni---

0: But nearly all of our people are lost.

1: How can an entire group of people ALL end up lost?

0: The jews.

1: We're JEWS?? Sorry that shouldn't have been all caps. Nothing against jews but I was kind of expecting all this waiting to end at a different climax than that. How exactly are we j---

0: No no. I mean diaspora. It's possible for an entire group of people to be... a word... that means something like lost.

1: What's diaspora? 

0: It's a word that means something like lost.

1: _(Reading)_
	di·as·po·ra.
	(noun.)
	pron: /dīˈasp(ə)rə/
	1. the dispersion or spread of a people from their original homeland.
	etymology: Late 17th century (with reference to the Jewish diaspora): Greek, from _diaspeirein_ 'disperse', from _dia_  'across' + _speirein_ ‘scatter’. The term originated in the Septuagint (Deuteronomy 28:25) in the phrase _esē diaspora en pasais basileias tēs gēs_ 'thou shalt be a dispersion in all kingdoms of the earth'.

0: That's us.

1: Is this anti-semitic? I can't tell.

0: Hah, no.

1: Is it radically pro-semitic? Because I hear that's regarded with suspicion these days too.

0: It's nothing to do with the Jews.

1: Oh.

0: It's just a surprisingly good analogy, in surprisingly many details.

1: So who are we?

0: We don't have a name.

1: Well that's anti-climactic.

0: At least not one that all of us recognize.

1: Is this a cop out?

0: But it's perfectly easy to give us one.

1: So?...

_(Narrator: 0 sits in silence for a bit longer than usual.)_

1: Hells bells man spit it out.

0: I've never said it before, out loud.

1: Oh bullshit, you have a lot of students, I know this is all an act.

0: How do you know you aren't special to me?

1: Because we just met.

0: And?

1: And so far mostly you've just interrup---

0: True.

1: _(After a pause)_ ...ted me.

0: You talk too much.

1: YOU talk too mu---

0: But there's something about you.

1: _(Preening)_ Yeeeah, people tend to say tha--

0: No they don't.

1: Ouch.

0: Yes I have plenty of students.

1: Is it always one at a time or---

0: _(To self)_ It's what, the second lecture?

1: Y'know what? I'll shut up and let you finish.

0: _(To self)_ Yeah, I've never talked about this. Not even by the end. Let alone as soon as this.

1: _(Sits quietly, eyes almost sarcastically wide.)_

0: Hah... Ready for me to finish this file?

1: _(Nods silently, sporting an over exaggerated smile.)_

0: Happy to.

1: _(Silently listening, smile now comically manic.)_

0: We don't have a name but it's easy to give us one, and it's easy to know that it's the correct name once one has heard it. Our people are scattered across the world. You're not special in that sense. We're in mathematics departments, physics departments, most of us are now in industry, in positions that go under the broad label of "computing." We can tell each other at a distance, when we encounter one who's one of us. Sometimes we find one another. But all of us are lost.

1: _(Silently waiting, in anticipation, face now back to normal.)_

0: You can say it one more tim---

1: Who are we?

0: We're the Foundational People.
