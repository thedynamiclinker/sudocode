A side effect of top-down design and planning.

Since [[Planning is Pretending]], the mind of the planner focuses primarily on how the system will work when all the pieces are operating as intended.

This leads to a top-down design that feels modular, but in practice leads to [[Avoid Fragile Modularity|Fragile Modularity]].

The resulting designs are overfit to perfection, in the sense that the whole system only works when every part is working perfectly.
