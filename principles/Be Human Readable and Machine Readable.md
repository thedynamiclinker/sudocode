All writing is for communication.

1. With machines.
2. With humans (including yourself in the future).

Obfuscated code is 1 but not 2.

Documentation is 2 but not 1.

The best way to spend your time as a developer is by writing code and storing data in forms that are both 1 and 2.

This is the model of the `/etc` directory in Unix.

Files in the `/etc` directory are not all required to have a common format.

What they all share is that they're all both 1 and 2.

Unix teaches us two lessons about plain-text.

Lesson 1 is to be human readable, and [[Standardize on Plain Text]].

Lesson 2 is that when the user is a programmer, being human readable is not the same as being user friendly. As a programmer, we also want our human readable text to have just enough structure that it can be easily parsed by simple code, ideally one-liners that you can write without thinking. Since [[Documentation Always Lags Reality]], the best documentation is the subset which is forced to keep itself up to date with a changing reality. The best way to achieve that is for the "documentation" to be constantly parsed and used by the code it's meant to document. A good example of this is the `.toml` file format, and this philosophy is reflected in [what TOML stands for](https://toml.io/en). In *The Elements of Programming Style*, Brian Kernighan expresses the same principle with the advice to "Make every comment count."

Whenever possible, avoid wasting too much time writing in formats that are only 1, or only 2.

That means:
- Less time spent writing in Confluence and READMEs.
- More time spent writing simple tests and minimal working examples of how to use your code.
- Whenever possible, avoid binary data formats.
- Storing data in non-human-readable binary formats like databases is almost always a form of premature optimization.
- Until you're absolutely certain that your application is IO bound and rate limited by access time to a specific type of data, it is premature to put that data into a non-human-readable format.
