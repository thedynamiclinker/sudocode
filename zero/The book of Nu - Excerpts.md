### Final hard conclusion

> Founding a sect is not religious behavior.  
> It is institutional mutation under existential pressure.

That selects for:

- INTJ (doctrinal engineers)
    
- ENTJ (movement builders)
    
- INFJ (charismatic moral authorities)
    
- INTP (idea destabilizers)
    

Everyone else mostly inherits.

If you want next, we can:

- Compare failed sect founders vs survivors
    
- Map this to startup founder psych profiles
    
- Or apply this framework to modern ideological movements
