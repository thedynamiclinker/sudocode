 ~ # man vi

SYNOPSIS
       The creation of life
```

And Dustin[^5] was alone, with no sniz[^6] corresponding to the strength that created him.[^7]

- _Todo: Etc etc something about animals and names._

And the LꞀ took a piece of his side.[^8]

- _Todo: Etc etc folk Vive etymology._

And she was named "Vivian"[^9]

[^1]: In the native language of the original text, the phrase "dust in" sounds like and may be related to the same language's word for the man later in the chapter, though of course this is merely conjecture.

[^2]: Lit. "breathed the dust in" in O.T.

[^3]: Late 15c., _snesen_, from or replacing _fnesen_, which is Old English _fneosan_,  from Proto-Germanic _*fneusanan_. Compare: Middle Dutch _fniesen_, Dutch _fniezen_, Old Norse _fnysa_, Old Norse _hnjosa_, Swedish _nysa_, Old High German _niosan_, German _niesen_, all from Proto-Germanic base _*fneu-s-_, which is of imitative origin, as is PIE _*pneu-_ "to breathe" (source of Greek _pnein_ "to breathe").

[^4]: Lit. "God bless you" in the original.

[^5]: This is the first mention of the name given to the man created by the LꞀ in the previous chapter.

[^6]: Possibly a reference to the "breath of life" from the prev. sec.

[^7]: Lit. "blew him into existence."

[^8]: O.T. has "side piece."

[^9]: Lit. "The Living One."
