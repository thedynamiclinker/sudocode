## The Sexist

Q: It seems that a lot of people disagree with Rand's argument against a woman President. What do you think of it? Do you think it reflected her loneliness?

Branden: I think it reflected a lot of things in her. I certainly don't agree with it. I wish Margaret Thatcher would run for President here. I'd vote for her. I think a lot about Ayn's theory of women came from the inevitable loneliness of the genius. Seeing so much that other people didn't see, with such ease and so clearly, necessarily creates a certain loneliness. When you see so much, so blindingly clearly, and you're surrounded by people who need it explained in detail and even with that sometimes don't see it, you end up feeling very alone.

Ayn would have given anything in the world to find an equal, and anything in the world — plus the next three worlds, if there are such — to have found a superior intellect. I think that longing, which was never fulfilled, had a lot to do with her focusing so much on a woman wanting to look up to a man. It was a very understandable and tragic result of her own need, a need we all have, but most of us can fulfill at least to some extent. She couldn't.

## The Good Guys

> International Jews
> 
> In violent opposition to all this sphere of Jewish effort rise the schemes of the International Jews. The adherents of this sinister confederacy are mostly men reared up among the unhappy populations of countries where Jews are persecuted on account of their race. Most, if not all, of them have forsaken the faith of their forefathers, and divorced from their minds all spiritual hopes of the next world. This movement among the Jews is not new. From the days of Spartacus-Weishaupt to those of Karl Marx, and down to Trotsky (Russia), Bela Kun (Hungary), Rosa Luxembourg (Germany), and Emma Goldman (United States), this world-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilisation and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence, and impossible equality, has been steadily growing. It played, as a modern writer, Mrs. Webster, has so ably shown, a definitely recognisable part in the tragedy of the French Revolution. It has been the mainspring of every subversive movement during the Nineteenth Century; and now at last this band of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great cities of Europe and America have gripped the Russian people by the hair of their heads and have become practically the undisputed masters of that enormous empire.

> Terrorist Jews
> 
> There is no need to exaggerate the part played in the creation of Bolshevism and in the actual bringing about of the Russian Revolution by these international and for the most part atheistical Jews. It is certainly a very great one; it probably outweighs all others. With the notable exception of Lenin, the majority of the leading figures are Jews. Moreover, the principal inspiration and driving power comes from the Jewish leaders. Thus Tchitcherin, a pure Russian, is eclipsed by his nominal subordinate Litvinoff, and the influence of Russians like Bukharin or Lunacharski cannot be compared with the power of Trotsky, or of Zinovieff, the Dictator of the Red Citadel (Petrograd), or of Krassin or Radek – all Jews. In the Soviet institutions the predominance of Jews is even more astonishing. And the prominent, if not indeed the principal, part in the system of terrorism applied by the Extraordinary Commissions for Combating Counter-Revolution has been taken by Jews, and in some notable cases by Jewesses. The same evil prominence was obtained by Jews in the brief period of terror during which Bela Kun ruled in Hungary. The same phenomenon has been presented in Germany (especially in Bavaria), so far as this madness has been allowed to prey upon the temporary prostration of the German people. Although in all these countries there are many non-Jews every whit as bad as the worst of the Jewish revolutionaries, the part played by the latter in proportion to their numbers in the population is astonishing.
