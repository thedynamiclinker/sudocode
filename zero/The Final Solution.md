Internationally organized very tightly and all talking to each other and kind of working as one mind. Who don't have the interest of the \[nations they live in\] at heart, they have their own interests at heart. And are animated by a deep hostility to the society that surrounds them._

## The Problem

Life can be confusing.

Especially in the modern world.

Lots of people have a culture, a language, and a history, but no home.

They're a people in diaspora, and they're especially lost when it comes to education.

They're not all developers. But the skill of developing something is exactly what they need.

Sometimes, when you're missing something, the solution is to find it.

Other times, you can't find it, because it doesn't exist yet.

In those situations, the solution is to build it.

So other people can find it.

And we don't have to be alone.
