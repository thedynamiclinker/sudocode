## Cantor Unsure if his discovery of different sizes of infinity was publishable

> _We can follow the ruminations of the 28-year-old Cantor in letters written in 1873 to Richard Dedekind, a young mathematician Cantor had met quite by chance the previous year while on vacation in Switzerland. Cantor, who had recently been promoted to a professorship at Halle, wrote showing Dedekind that (as we have already seen), one can construct a one-to-one matching between the natural numbers and the more inclusive set of all positive fractions. He even showed that the same is true for the set of all algebraic numbers. In his letter, Cantor raised the question of the possibility of a one-to-one matching between the set of natural numbers and the set of all real numbers. Dedekind’s reply suggested that he believed the question to be of little interest. About a week later, in another letter, Cantor was able to prove to Dedekind the remarkable fact that the set of real numbers cannot be matched with the set of natural numbers in a one-to-one manner, that infinite sets come in at least two sizes._

> _Apparently, Cantor himself wasn’t even sure that this finding was worth publishing. He only submitted it for publication after his former teacher Karl Weierstrass encouraged him to do so. The revolutionary implications of what Cantor had done were hardly evident in the four-page paper. The emphasis of the paper was not on the fact that infinite sets had been shown to come in more than one size, but rather that as a corollary, Cantor had obtained a new proof that there exist real numbers that are transcendental._

## On Turing's eccentricities at Bletchley Park

> _In the first week of June each year \[Turing\] would get a bad attack of hay fever, and he would cycle to the office wearing a service gas mask to screen the pollen. His bicycle had a fault: the chain would come off at regular intervals. Instead of having it mended he would count the number of times the pedals went round and would get off the bicycle in time to adjust the chain by hand._

## On Turing and Joan Clarke, 1941

> _In the spring of 1941, Alan Turing made a proposal of marriage to Joan Clarke, one of the rare women at Bletchley Park who wasn’t relegated to a mindless clerical job. Joan Clarke had been studying mathematics at Cambridge when she was recruited for code-breaking. A few days after the proposal Turing confessed to her that he had “homosexual tendencies” but the engagement continued for several more months before he felt he had to call it off._

## On Turing's 1942-43 mission and meetings at Bell Labs

> _In November 1942, Turing was sent on a mission to Washington, D.C., to help coordinate code-breaking activities between England and the United States. Following that assignment, he spent the first two months of 1943 at Bell Laboratories, at the time located on West Street in New York City. There he met Harry Nyquist (1889-1976), who pioneered the theory of digital sampling, and Claude Elwood Shannon (1916-2001), whose paper “A Mathematical Theory of Communication” (1948) would found the field of information theory and introduce the word "bit" to the world._
