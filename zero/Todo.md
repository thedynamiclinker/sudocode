## The scaffolding era
- [x] Cut a lot from /opt/art.
- [ ] Cut a bit from /sys/kernel/Definition
- [ ] Cut some out of ld.so.
- [ ] Finish lost+found today, in a few hours.

## The calm era
- [ ] Add some logicomix pictures where they're relevant.
- [ ] Organize everything in /zero/include and /include using the /etc/group layout as in /zero/etc-apache.
- [ ] A huge amount of the story after lost+found is already there in the /dev directory. Take some calm low energy days and just transcribe the quotes in that directory verbatim and use it to build the skeleton of a story. You don't need to be working at maximum intensely to put together a story you already have right in front of you.
- [ ] Type up "How to handle your boss" from Grace Hopper video and add it to /sys/kernel/definition.


## /usr/sbin/shutdown
