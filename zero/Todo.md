Voevodsky How I became interested in Foundations of Mathematics 3:40. Transcribe this quote! It belongs at the very top of /etc/group!

Voevodsky Foundations talk 20:16. "It was inspired by the ideas of higher category theory which was kind of mysterious and... fashionable at that time." Beautiful. Heard this talk at least 5 times before but somehow never saw. This needs to be central to the book, this story.
