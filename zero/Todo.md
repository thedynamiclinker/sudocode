## /
- [ ] Do a complete run through of the book, start to finish, and take notes on what isn't done.

## Full Pass Todo
- [ ] Cut a lot from /opt/art, a bit from /sys/kernel/Definition (rename?) and cut some out of ld.so.

## /zero
- [ ] Organize everything in /zero/include and /include using the /etc/group layout as in /zero/etc-apache.
- [ ] Add some logicomix pictures where they're relevant.
- [ ] A huge amount of the story after lost+found is already there in the /dev directory. Take some calm low energy days and just transcribe the quotes in that directory verbatim and use it to build the skeleton of a story. You don't need rocket fuel forever to put together a story you already have right in front of you.

## /usr/sbin/shutdown

In the end, remember:
