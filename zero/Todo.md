Exceptions that prove the rule:

| **Emil Post**                  | 1897       | 34            | Poland (Russian Empire)                        | USA (New York)                          | Recursion, Post problem                    |

Emil Post was born Feb 11th, 1897, so the first and second rounds of US conscription for WWI just missed his age group by 6 months. Further, he was missing his left arm from a car crash at age 12 in 1909.

Heyting was the right age too, but Netherlands was neutral and did not enter WWI.

First round of US conscription grabbed anyone born between 1887 and 1896.
Second got everyone born after June 5, 1897.

> The first, on June 5, 1917, was for all men between the ages of 21 and 30. · The second, on June 5, 1918, registered those who attained age 21 after June 5, 1917

Physics: A Documented Case

Historians such as Gerald Holton, Paul Forman, and John Heilbron have noted that many of the founders of quantum mechanics were born 1900–1905 (Heisenberg 1901, Pauli 1900, Dirac 1902, Schrödinger 1887, Born 1882, Jordan 1902).

The slightly older “establishment” physicists — Planck (1858), Einstein (1879), Sommerfeld (1868) — largely survived but were already senior or isolated.

The intermediate generation (1880–1895) was decimated by the war or by its economic aftermath.

Thus, young men in their twenties were thrust early into research and professorships during the 1920s.
Sommerfeld, for instance, had no one older to fill junior posts, so he took on prodigies like Heisenberg and Pauli directly.

This gap helps explain the astonishing youth of the 1925–1930 revolution in physics: the “quantum generation” averaged around 25–27 years old at publication of their key papers.
