Write the Category Theoretical definition of J's lost Genesis 1.

Calling:
- The original text J(0)
- The Priestly map P (this takes any text and rewrites it in Priestly Source style).
- The Revelation map R (this does a sort of line by line Atbash of a text, reversing the lines but not the letters: Last line goes to first and first line goes to last. And then connotation arithmetic that swaps the Children's Book feel of Genesis with a Horror Movie feel of Revelation. So swap order + swap vibes is the Revelation map, call it R).
- The Psalm map ψ is a non-deterministic compression algorithm that describes things it's aware of using a small set of references.

We can define J(0) by the following Universal Properties:

P(J(0)) ≈ Genesis 1
R(J(0)) ≈ Revelation
ψ(J(0)) ≈ Several short descriptions of creation involving a dragon named "RHB", who YHWH slays.

We also know the following about the output of the J map. For any input n:
- J(n) is intensely punny.
- J(n) contains brief but unmistakable references to Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian, and Ugaritic creation stories and legends.
- J(n) is not entirely clear about whether YHWH is a "good guy", and moral ambiguity is pervasive.
- J(n) loves puns on the name of Rehoboam, seems to be writing during his rein, and criticizes him from as many plausibly deniable directions as possible.

Using that category theoretic definition, try to improve the translation.


> _Ok so now Joseph Smith, in his twenties, he's this uneducated unreligious treasure hunter. And he starts to focus in on something totally new. In the words of one believing Mormon historian, Richard Bushman, he starts to orient himself away from treasure, and towards translation. He's becoming a prophet._

> _Joseph Smith's Church did indeed have a lot of the ingredients of the religious movements of the time. Last days, Apocalypse, preparing God's kingdom on the Earth, preparing for the Millennium. This was all trending at the time, this was not surprising. But! A lot of this stuff was totally new fringe doctrine. God has a body and a wife? This was a completely wild blend of Jewish folk mysticism, American folk magic, reincartion, evangelical Christianity, and eventually he even wove in Freemasonry. A totally fresh thing. There was nothing quite like it. It was super unique and super potent, and super polarizing._
