## /usr/bin/*

The education of user, uid 1, in /usr, through the format of _Idk Howtos._

1. [[mouse|/usr/bin/mouse]], using code from [[mouse.so.1|/usr/lib/mouse.so.1]]

2. Make a hello world display server by reading whichever device file it's using (/dev/fb0), reverse engineering the format, and then writing to that device file.

3. Reading an image file out of memory.
	1. Open a browser, and open any image in that browser.
	2. It's now somewhere in your machine's memory.
	3. Given no other information, figure out how to write code to read that image out of memory.

4. Reading a GET request in transit.
	1. Open a browser, click on a link.
	2. Figure out the request it sent when you clicked, in sufficient detail that we can replay the same request and get the same result.

5. Write a Hello World filesystem.
	1. Get a USB key, and fill it full of zeroes. No filesystem, no nothing.
	2. Don't format it. That's cheating.
	3. Now write code that'll let you store a file on it, and then read the file back after the USB key is unplugged and plugged back in.
	4. Now write code to "delete" the file (overwrite the table of contents entry).
	5. Now write code that lets you "undelete" the file and recover it.


## /bin/fmt

Generally speaking, there are two formats in which publishers choose to publish Sudocode.

The minimalist and the maximalist.

(Write more of this file, and explain that the maximalist or canonical versions are hardback, in full color, reproducing exactly the images in the original, and typically on A4 paper. The minimalist or protesting versions are generally paperback, with small pages designed to be held in the hand and carried, in black and white (or sometimes black, red, and blue) with all images translated to plain text, and designed for ease of publication and distribution in large numbers at an affordable price. They believe the words of Sudocode are what is essential, and the ostentatious format is a priestly dilution of the original intent.)

## /etc/principles

> _When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure._
> -Goodhart's law

- Take ALL the old Principles that are good enough to publish, and cat them all together in one directory called /etc/principles 

- The Paul character says you don't have to follow the /etc/principles since the message is no longer just a message for developers.

## /tmp

/tmp is where the apocrypha go.

A lot of the stuff currently in /etc goes there.

It contains both deleted scenes and fanfiction.

The following files are found in /tmp, without explanation:
- And Joseph said `fortune | lolcat`, for he was a dream master of many colors.
- And Josh said to the tree: `figlet you be cursed now and forever`
- `vi qra` 1 The L||D called to Drew and spoke to him from the 十t of meeting. He said, 2 “Speak to the Developers and say to them:wq

## /etc/brdfdr

This should be a parable.
Make the Son of J say them.
Son of J often refers back to the /etc/principles

- Add Noah screenshot and Children's Bible Coloring book picture to /etc/brdfdr.
- Add "Build your own fucking birdfeeder" screenshot from POC||GTFO to [[brdfdr]].

## Qoph: The Secret /etc/group that the Son of J refers to using the Camel & Eye of Needle hint

- The new /etc/group that 0 & 1 start after the night time scene is where the old LSTJ content goes, both from the original dialogue between J/G/A, and from the dialogues in How to Control Everything.

- We never say explicitly which "letter" the group corresponds to. Implicitly, it's hinted that 0 & 1 dug up the two old unused Greek letters San and Qoppa for this purpose, and it's hinted that Qoppa is their group. ("A letter without a people for a people without a letter.")

- The "J\*s" they start is what leads to the book itseld, following the logic at the end of How to Control Everything ("We need to write a book. Five books actually.")

- This "J\*s" they start is why they send the email in /etc/frag.d/Cat Email.

- It's also why 0 is texting 1 about early XP sects at night in the file Textus Nocturnus: they're researching how to start "A People." ("How to have sects.")

- It's also why the commentaries, the footnotes, the translators notes, the gospel-style writings in lost+found, and all the other documents that talk about "LD culture" and "The Original Sources" eventually end up getting written: 0 & 1's idea succeeds and eventually ends up becoming the foundation of a large fraction of the world's civilizations and cultures.

- It's also why some sources refer to the era near when 0 & 1 first wrote as 0x00 P.A.: the clock was eventually reset to measure history from when they wrote.

- It's also the reason for all the apocyphal and fragmentary documents like LSTJ and How to Control Everything, when 0 & 1 appear to be doing research on the founders of religious sects and "The Behaviors of Creators," and why they keep referring to trying to "Get Root on the Universe."

- The story of Sudocode is a mixture of developer culture and education, interspersed with the story from On the Lamb (minus the songs and such.)

- It's also why /boot happens before /lost+found: that's "The Authors" deciding that 0 & 1 are on the right track, and sending them to wander in lost+found to discover what their purpose is.

- It's also why the text in /sys/kernel/Sudo Code ends up getting written.

- Eventually, we hint that "The Authors" up in kernel space actually _are_ the 0 & 1 characters, _after_ having "gotten root on the universe" and becoming the foundational chars of a new era of both "developer history" (our people) and eventually human history (as the texts that were originally just for the chosen people end up getting syncretized and universalized to all the cultures of the earth by latter day writers.)

- This is essentially the same story as Radicalize, from a different perspective, but this one is a puzzle that can be reverse engineered and figured out _by using_ the developer skills they teach in the book.
