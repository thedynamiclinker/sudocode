## Todo

0 & 1 religion dialogue: Establish that 0 is 51% atheist and 49% polytheist. The only unreasonable position is monotheism. If upstairs exists, then it exists. And if that's the case, then there's obviously more than one motherfucker up there. You can't have a whole world with one guy. And if we can, then we can't have a world with one guy who makes a world 

Leibniz as an extreme example of a "non-mathematician." The following quote is absolutely perfect.

![[leibniz-insults-pure-mathematics.jpg]]

A narrative version of the Leibniz story from On the Lamb and the old Wall belongs in lost+found/2/3.

The Universal Computer by Martin Davis has some amazing background content on Leibniz's thought process and it feels much more modern and relatable than expected.

Apparently Leibniz was running around his entire life being like "Guys, we have to build The Thing." He called it his "wonderful idea" and no one gave a shit or noticed. 

The story of his "Universal characteristic" is badass. This guy absolutely knew what was possible and nobody understood wtf he was talking about.

Leibniz needs to be a character in the book.

His (otherwise unusual) belief that this is the "best of all possible worlds" will be explained as the same suspicion the 0 character has: not as an idealistic religious or rationalist dogma, but as an ever present suspicion that the world may actually be a game, a simulation, or a joke by the Authors of the universe, whoever they are.

Put the Leibniz story in /bin/ary.

Leibniz and the I\*ching.

"God damn this wig is itchy" was on the Wall version of this story 8 years ago and I didn't even notice the obvious "I Ching" pun when the hexagrams and binary came up two seconds after.

The Logicians vs the Engineers.

Where did computer science come from? A second long begat list in Andrew Appel talk around 39:40.


Voevodsky How I became interested in Foundations of Mathematics 3:40. Transcribe this quote! It belongs at the very top of /etc/group!

Voevodsky Foundations talk 20:16. "It was inspired by the ideas of higher category theory which was kind of mysterious and... fashionable at that time." Beautiful. Heard this talk at least 5 times before but somehow never saw. This needs to be central to the book, this story.

## My Struggle (with אל): The Story of an Accidental Deity

In /boot, 0 and 1 discover some documents written in Proto Canaanite that tell the story of יהוה encountering the Pantheon and deciding he wanted that at home. Implements the same system as a monokernel. Becomes famous. In interviews, when asked about morality or grand visions for the next thousand years, he always says "I'm really just about the technical things. The seeds and multiplying. I leave the philosophy to other people." 0 reads the text and translates it in a very unclear and evasive way for 1.

## Move this stuff to man(8).

24 letters in Greek.
26 in Latin.
Add the two back to Greek.
And notice the following ritual:
https://www.liturgicalartsjournal.com/2019/06/ceremonies-of-consecration-of-churches.html?m=1

> _Before the time of Constantine the consecration of churches was, on account of the persecutions, necessarily private, but after the conversion of that emperor it became a solemn public rite, as appears from Eusebius of Cæsarea (Church History X): "After these things a spectacle earnestly prayed for and much desired by us all appeared, viz. the solemnization of the festival of the dedication of churches throughout every city, and the consecration of newly-built oratories." The passage clearly indicates that churches were consecrated before, and that accordingly the anniversaries of the dedication might now be publicly celebrated._

> _Of course, what the precise form of this consecration was is not entirely clear, but "we find occasional notices of the vigil kept before the consecration, of the translation of the relics, and of the tracing of the Greek and the Latin alphabet on the pavement of the church... Often only the Greek alphabet or the Latin was written twice; and sometimes to the Greek and Latin the Hebrew alphabet was added (Martène, De Antiquis Ecclesiæ Ritibus, II)." (Source: Catholic Encyclopedia)_

> _"The question that naturally arises, of course, is what the particular symbolism of the Latin and Greek alphabets is?"_

Approximate Timeline
- J: 950-850 BCE
- E: 850-750 BCE
- JE: combined after 722 BC
- D (core): ~620 BC (Josiah)
- D (expanded, exilic): 600-550 BC
- P (final form): 550-450 BC
- Final Torah redaction: 450-350 BC

Where scholars disagree the most:
- Whether E was a full source or just fragments.
- Whether P is entirely late, or has early parts.
- Whether R was one person/group or multiple waves.

Deuteronomy 20:10-15.
- 10 When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace.
- 11 If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you.
- 12 If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city.
- 13 When the Lord your God delivers it into your hand, put to the sword all the men in it.
- 14 As for the women, the children, the livestock and everything else in the city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves. And you may use the plunder the Lord your God gives you from your enemies.
- 15 This is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby.

Include the story of the templ8 4k.
It's the funniest story of all time.
Explains the Priestly source perfectly.

Now we turn to page 666 of Commentary on the Torah where we find Deuteronomy 32, the famous "When the Highest gave nations legacies" passage, which was redacted into obscurity until the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls.
