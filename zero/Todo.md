1. Turing section: I Carus, K, and To Those Who Have Seen.
2. Gödel section: Needs some genuine real feeling paranoia that doesnt feel like a gimmick.

Göd:
> Why would I trust you, after all? I don't mean this in any sense adversarially. I only mean to ask what is the benefit of this thing we call trust when we speak, like this, between strangers who pretend perhaps malignantly to be friends. Perhaps benevolently. But objectively, the circumstances at present are more in favor on net balance of the hypothesis that suggests caution as a consequence. Who did you say you are again? "A friend"? Pardon my brevity and please forgive if it's curt by there's nothing I feel less comfortable about than this current situation, please never contact again. I have nothing specific against you, but I hope you'll understand if I say I don't feel comfortable and that I intend to have the Post Office block your address and if possible any future incoming message from your postal code and several adjacent from doing, what was your word for it? "Contacting" me? Yes I hope sincerely that we need not do this contact again. I place no blame on you specifically, except insofar as you fit cleanly into the plan of They who've been set for some time now on destroying me. I should normally like to apologize around this part of a letter. But in this case I'd rather prefer to say that if you find yourself occupied with any sort of confused feeling (not to put too fine a point on it but just to say it simply) simply read it again until it makes sense. Please do not make an attempt to contact me or my family e.g., Ad until everything above makes sense. Thank you and I sincerely apologize. I wish you could understand how intense is this apology. More soon.

Oh and equally important: "To those who have seen" goes in Turing, toward the end.

The Book needs to use the 0xPA calendar, and everything occurs circa nearabouts 0x08 P.A., with @2 coming onto the scene around 0x05 on the dot, the earliest sources being of course Radicalize and the Eclipse which go back all the way to like 0x00 P.A. and exactly Zero.

Like to 0x00 Y && M && d && h && m && s.

Sincerely,
-E, circa 0x8 PA and almost 3 月.

## lost+found

Problem
- Something is blocking us from marking anything as finished.
- The blocker may be the sequencing.
- The blocker may be the images.
- The blocker may be mental.
- Still, we need to finish.
- lost+found, that is.

Solution

- [x] lost+found/1
	- [x] 1
	- [x] 2
	- [x] 3
	- [x] 4
	- [x] 5

- [ ] lost+found/2
	- [x] 1
	- [x] 2
	- [ ] 3
	- [ ] 4
	- [x] 5

- [ ] lost+found/3
	- [x] 1
	- [ ] 2
	- [ ] 3
	- [ ] 4
	- [ ] 5

- [ ] lost+found/4
	- [x] 1
	- [ ] 2
	- [ ] 3
	- [ ] 4
	- [ ] 5

- [ ] lost+found/5
	- [ ] 1
	- [ ] 2
	- [ ] 3
	- [ ] 4
	- [ ] 5
