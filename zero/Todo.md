- /var/spool (short for "S. Pאוl") is Paul's outgoing mail queue.
- /var/mail is where the epistles live.
- /var/www is (probably) where Revelation goes, near the end: www is "lol" in Japanese.

- Take ALL the old Principles that are good enough to publish, and cat them all together in one directory called /opt/law or something similar.

- The Paul character says you don't have to follow the /etc/principles since the message is no longer just a message for developers.

The spread of the book will be an extremely easy thing to do, but will require an organized multi publisher marketing effort that amounts to a sort of retcon or benevolent gaslighting, and it absolutely will not be designed to make money, gain fame, or sell books. As in Christianity, the messiah must not be a human person who sticks around and gets power for being that. Any messiah but be a near fictional (or entirely fictional) character in a book, who is asserted to have existed (and maybe does) but is then said to have died or disappeared. This is a general rule, not just a fact about the Jesus character. The Satoshi figure in bitcoin is exactly the same archetype, and bitcoin went from $0 to over a TRILLION in market cap because it WASN'T product by a company or a man. It came into the world basically ex nihilo, by a character no one knows the name of, who then disappeared forever, leaving billions of dollars unclaimed.

Any proper implementation of the biblical api must stick to that blueprint religiously.

Write the plan of attack.

Write the character.

Write the story.

Write the Son of J.

Coming soon.

Amen.

## The Group

- The new /etc/group that 0 & 1 start after the night time scene is where the old LSTJ content goes, both from the original dialogue between J/G/A, and from the dialogues in How to Control Everything.

- We never say explicitly which "letter" the group corresponds to. Implicitly, it's hinted that 0 & 1 dug up the two old unused Greek letters San and Qoppa for this purpose, and it's hinted that Qoppa is their group. ("A letter without a people for a people without a letter.")

- The "J\*s" they start is what leads to the book itseld, following the logic at the end of How to Control Everything ("We need to write a book. Five books actually.")

- This "J\*s" they start is why they send the email in /etc/frag.d/Cat Email.

- It's also why 0 is texting 1 about early XP sects at night in the file Textus Nocturnus: they're researching how to start "A People." ("How to have sects.")

- It's also why the commentaries, the footnotes, the translators notes, the gospel-style writings in lost+found, and all the other documents that talk about "LD culture" and "The Original Sources" eventually end up getting written: 0 & 1's idea succeeds and eventually ends up becoming the foundation of a large fraction of the world's civilizations and cultures.

- It's also why some sources refer to the era near when 0 & 1 first wrote as 0x00 P.A.: the clock was eventually reset to measure history from when they wrote.

- It's also the reason for all the apocyphal and fragmentary documents like LSTJ and How to Control Everything, when 0 & 1 appear to be doing research on the founders of religious sects and "The Behaviors of Creators," and why they keep referring to trying to "Get Root on the Universe."

- The story of Sudocode is a mixture of developer culture and education, interspersed with the story from On the Lamb (minus the songs and such.)

- It's also why /boot happens before /lost+found: that's "The Authors" deciding that 0 & 1 are on the right track, and sending them to wander in lost+found to discover what their purpose is.

- It's also why the text in /sys/kernel/Sudo Code ends up getting written.

- Eventually, we hint that "The Authors" up in kernel space actually _are_ the 0 & 1 characters, _after_ having "gotten root on the universe" and becoming the foundational chars of a new era of both "developer history" (our people) and eventually human history (as the texts that were originally just for the chosen people end up getting syncretized and universalized to all the cultures of the earth by latter day writers.)

- This is essentially the same story as Radicalize, from a different perspective, but this one is a puzzle that can be reverse engineered and figured out _by using_ the developer skills they teach in the book.
