American Jacob Story

_The Usurper and the Red Man._

And America had twin sons.
The older was named Blaze.
The younger was named Victor.
And Victor said:

> Hey Red Man, sell me your birthright.
> I'll give you these beads.

I do not come to preach to your beliefs.
I come to preach to your doubts.

Gather every doubt you have
and bring them to me.

No one who comes to the word
without every doubt in them
can begin to hear the word.

The more doubt you bring me,
the more truth you may
eventually come to hear.

The `cat email` mistake needs to be included as something that 0 & 1 accidentally send to Chet 

```
~ $ cat emails
bash-maintainers@gnu.org
bug-bash@gnu.org
chet.ramey@case.edu
```

```sh
~ $ cat emails | while read email; do cat email | mail -s "A Bug in History" "$email"; done
```

1: Aaand just to be safe, before we run the command, let's toss an `echo` in front to print out the commands we're about the execute to make sure they're all right.

```sh
~ $ cat emails | while read email; do echo cat email | mail -s "A Bug in History" "$email"; done
```

1: And, go!

_(Narrator: 1 hits enter.)_

1: Wait why's it not printing?

0: _(Eyes widen)_

1: What's going on with your face? And why isn't it printing?

0: Check your "sent" folder.

1: What?

_(Narrator: 0 & 1 then realize that 1 just sent the string `cat email` to everyone in the list.)_

The Hebrew language had been almost completely lost. Nobody spoke it natively anymore. Hebrew in the 1920s was like Latin is now.
