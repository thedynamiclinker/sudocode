## An Absolute Bohr

> _In the evening, when a handful of Bohr’s students were “working” in the Paa Blegdamsvej Institute, discussing the latest problems of the quantum theory, or playing Ping-pong on the library table with coffee cups placed on it to make the game more difficult, Bohr would appear, complaining that he was very tired, and would like to “do something.” To “do something” inevitably meant to go to the movies, and the only movies Bohr liked were those called **The Gun Fight at the Lazy Gee Ranch** or **The Lone Ranger and a Sioux Girl**. But it was hard to go with Bohr to the movies. He could not follow the plot, and was constantly asking us, to the great annoyance of the rest of the audience, questions like this: “Is that the sister of that cowboy who shot the Indian who tried to steal a herd of cattle belonging to her brother-in-law?”_
> 
> _The same slowness of reaction was apparent at scientific meetings. Many a time, a visiting young physicist (most physicists visiting Copenhagen were young) would deliver a brilliant talk about his recent calculations on some intricate problem of the quantum theory. Everybody in the audience would understand the argument quite clearly, but Bohr wouldn’t. So everybody would start to explain to Bohr the simple point he had missed, and in the resulting turmoil everybody would stop understanding anything. Finally, after a considerable period of time, Bohr would begin to understand, and it would turn out that what he understood about the problem presented by the visitor was quite different from what the visitor meant, and was correct, while the visitor’s interpretation was wrong._

## lost+found

Problem
- Something is blocking us from marking anything as finished.
- The blocker may be the sequencing.
- The blocker may be the images.
- The blocker may be mental.
- Still, we need to finish.
- lost+found, that is.

Solution

- [x] lost+found/1
