> You expect me to believe there was really a guy named _Bool_? They're doing the Ammon and Moab thing. This is myth. It's an established genre of myth. That doesn't diminish the story, but it's absurd to believe these people existed.

## Poetry

> Poetry is defined by structured patterning of language. Historically this means:
>
> Meter (regular rhythm—e.g., Greek dactylic hexameter, Sanskrit śloka, Hebrew parallelism)
> 
> Lineation (written in discrete lines)
> 
> Structured patterning (of various forms)
>
> Compression or heightened diction
> 
> The essential feature across ancient cultures is metrical form—some predictable, repeatable pattern of stresses, syllables parallel clauses, or even ideas (e.g., Isaiah).
> 
> In other words, if it lacks formal patterning, it’s not poetry in the classical sense.

> _Discovery is a child’s privilege. I mean the small child, the child who is not afraid to be wrong, to look silly, to not be serious, and to act differently from everyone else. He is also not afraid that the things he is interested in are in bad taste or turn out to be different from his expectations, from what they should be, or rather he is not afraid of what they actually are. He ignores the silent and flawless consensus that is part of the air we breathe – the consensus of all the people who are, or are reputed to be, reasonable._

There are miracles in this text, but they're not the places where it says a miracle occurred.

They're the fact that this book is undoubtedly the most popular meme of all time.

That whatever the early Christians and Muslims and even Mormons were up to, they all chose to include it in whatever they were doing, first.

That despite fratricide, to father-daughter incest, to two sisters/wives/sisterwives adversarially breeding the help in a truly fertile form of sibling rivalry pun intended, to a drunken father cursing his son (and grandson, who wasn't involved) for seeing his dick when the dad was passed out drunk and his dick flopped out while he was sleeping (there but for the grace of... back to the story) to fathers almost killing their sons because a voice they heard told them to, to a god who forgets to do a daily task one day and then makes it up the next day, to a god so limited he loses track of the people he just created, to a snake who's pretty clearly The Author (the living one) and quote me on that, to an Author who makes the first ever created guy be named Guy, to an Author who writes (more or less, in the original language) "I'll call you Drew, because I drew you from the water," to a page later when Drew has a kid and names him Foreigner because he's out of town after killing a guy and going on the lamb and getting married because of it, to a girl whose name means "lamb" showing up with a flock of lambs, to a guy who gets a really rad shirt and then his siblings get sick of his shit and borderline kill him before he lives and goes down to Egypt and becomes Jafar.

AND THAT'S JUST THE PROTAGONISTS!

And that's just the first chapter, plus a few pages of the next.

This book is _wild._

You don't have to believe a word of it to see why.

But then archaeologists start digging up shit in the ground and tracing the origins of old writing systems and it's pretty clear some nonzero amount of this shit is true.

The bible's beyond intense.

It's some of the weirdest writing ever, and the most misinterpreted, because it's read by some of the most retarded people on earth not counting the Marxists cuz that's unfair (they're the Special Olympics of thought let's be real here c'mon.)

There are miracles in this text.

But it's not the spots where they describe the miracles.

The miracle of this text is that it somehow trolled its way through some combination of hilarious jokes and nonfiction honestly into being in the bedside drawer of hotel rooms about 3000 years later.

And if there's any single individual who can be credited with all that, or at least with getting the ball rolling, then it's an Author, from about 3000 years back, and maybe a woman.

For lack of a better term,
she's known to history as J.

We the Authors have come
with the gospel of her son.

# Son of J

> I speak of a character who is no one,
> Of a boy called a healer from birth.
> And whose name was not written.

> But he was not god.
> Nor his son, nor a spirit.
> He was the Son of J.

> And he was not one named
> J's Son, or Yah's Own, or Yah's Son.
> He was not one named these.
