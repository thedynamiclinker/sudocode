## lost+found

Problem
- Something is blocking us from marking anything as finished.
- The blocker may be the sequencing.
- The blocker may be the images.
- The blocker may be mental.
- Still, we need to finish.

Solution
- Segregate the bits of lost+found based on whether they're finished.
- Go through the entire directory and separate out the finished from the unfinished.
