The big Ω represents the unrestrained infinite of Cantor and the Large Cardinal culture.

The circle with an X through it is the contradiction. The three mountains below are Church, Gödel, and Turing.

The characters below those three mountains are 日 on the right, 月 left, and 曰 in the middle.

The middle mountain is Gödel giving birth the the four subcultures of ω, the standard foundations of Mathematics: set theory, proof theory, model theory, and recursion theory.

The Π and Σ next to recursion theory on the right are Computability and Reverse Mathematics respectively, representing the Kleene Mostowski hierarchy.

The small ω representing set theory immediately heads back up the mountain toward Ω and the inconsistency, leaving trails saying "Inaccessible," "Measurable," "0 sharp," and eventually I3, I2, I1, I0, the word Reinhardt crossed out and then 0 = 1 representing the Kunen inconsistency.

χ is probability and statistics

ψ is scientific computing

θ is topology

Λ is mathematical logic, the Abraham and Isaac figure combined (prolific, but also essentially sacrificed and passive against the backdrop of Mathematics before it birthed the two cultures of computing)

μ is "standard computing" (Unix, C, hacker culture, all of computing except the lambdas who preceeded them).

The μ people are the Jacob figure of the story.

λ is the firstborn of Λ, functional programming and lambda calculus, who has been mostly obscure since μ's success took λ's birthright in exchange for some soup or something. (Lit. "Red stuff." Generally believed to be curry.)

The idea is that μ is much better for almost everything, for a few decades. But once problems reach a certain level of difficulty, λ alone can tame complexity, and the story of λ and μ reuniting is the story of realizing what happens at the top of the λ cube in a practical μ-style computing system once you have dependent types (strong λ culture) plus a good user interface designed by actual practically minded developers (μ).

San (the deprecated Greek letter that looks like Μ and sounds like Σ) is the intuitionists: Misunderstood, but the secret that everyone has been missing.

What happens when μ and λ reunite is that all the fields of Ex Scriptura (Creation "Out of Writing") realize that computing (the descendants of Λ) are the true foundations of mathematics, and the "infinite" ωs and standard foundations become a subset of the finite intuitionistic type theories of the Λ culture.
