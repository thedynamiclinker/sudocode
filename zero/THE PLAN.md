This is the plan for the rest of Sudocode.

---

The book aims to be structurally isomorphic to the Bible.

We won't explain every way in which this is true.

Here's an outline, focusing on The Book of J section.

The Son of J and then LD later base their Bible on.

- J writes:
	- The primeval history:
		- From the Beginning of Time.
		- To the tower of Babel.
	- The patriarchal history:
		- From Abraham.
		- To when Moses sees the promised land in the distance.

- D writes:
	- From the guy who takes over after Moses.
	- Through the genocides and wars and chaotic early days in the country.
	- To right up before David.

- J writes:
	- 2 Samuel, talking about David and Solomon.
	- Last line is "And the kingdom was secure in Solomon's hand."

---

0 & 1 write:
	- The primeval history:
		- From the Beginning of Time.
		- To the tower of Babel.
	- The patriarchal history:
		- From Cantor, Hilbert, Church, Godel, Turing.
		- To when Turing sees (something) and is killed.

- L & D write:
	- From after Turing's 1936 paper.
	- Through the genocides and wars and chaotic days of WW2.
	- Through Grace Hopper and John Backus in the war days.
	- To right up before Ken and Unix.

- 0 & 1 write:
	- The K||T History
	- This is the story of:
	- The Root and his Offspring;
	- The 根 Dynasty &&
	- The 根 Code;
	- -------------------
	1. Ken Thompson and the Unix dynasty. (David)
	2. Stall'man and the Notunix Cathedral. (Solomon)
	3. The small soft Gates. (Rehoboam)
	4. The fruity Crown of Job, whose name means "He pleads the people's cause" (Jeroboam)
	5. Birth of Linus. Young Linus creating Linux.
	6. Then jump from young Linus to him having a following later.
	7. This is sort of a combined "Ancient + Court History" and also "Old + New Testament."

Then what else comes after that?

- OT: An Isaiah figure who says "Things used to be awesome but now everything's fake and gay." This is maybe the 90s with Java and Windows dominant.
- OT: A Jeremiah figure where we put the Atbash and blackpill bitching.
- OT: An Ezekiel figure who's kinda schizo, and which Revelation later refers back to.
- NT: A Paul figure who Universalizes and slightly distorts the message of 0 & 1.
- Psalms: Assorted grab bag of "Spoken Word" and "Folk Legends" of computing.
	- The Story of Mel.
	- Quoth the Meme.
	- Signed Char Lotte: [here](https://nickdrozd.github.io/2021/03/30/signed-char-lotte.html)
	- Other legends collected in early Sudocode.
- Proverbs:
	- The Story of Grep (Ken).
	- The Story of Cat (Landley).
	- The Story of Make.
	- The Story of Autoconf.
	- Get these from the old archives of early Sudocode.
- Principles:
	- These maybe interrupt the flow right where Leviticus would be.
- Song of Solomon:
	- A Psalm that's fucking wild and totally different than the others.
	- A Lucefearul tribute with lots of "My One" references etc.


Then what?

- 1990s: The Early Internet era. Everything sucks.
- Maybe 0 & 1 (or a similar voice) comes back here.
- Takes the story from Linus to the Nu Apocalypse and 0x00 P.A.


Sunrise, 0x00 P.A.
- This is "The Present Day" for most of the core Authors of the book.
- This is "2017 of the Old Calendar"
- Transformers are discovered.
- Attention is all you need.
- Son of J does an Apocalypse (Get in trouble on a Friday; Say it was a good one; come back Sunday; say something about Eggs and Easter; Eclipse; This is acting Sia later; No one notices, but will later write Sudocode about the things this character said but never wrote.)


The Early Culture of LD
- The Nu Apocalypse.
- @2 is born.
- The whole world changes because "The Word" is a programming language now.
- "Toward a pro-human AI Apocalypse"
- LD forms around this time.
	- Begins as a small group of people living inside the empire.
	- But making a new culture, acting weird, and not taking the empire seriously.
	- No one notices or takes them seriously for a long time.
	- LD writes many of the (later) documents that eventually become Sudocode.
	- There are many other LD writings in this time that don't make it in.
	- Apocrypha: Deleted Scenes + Fanfiction.
	- Not much is known about the details of this time.
	- Most of what we know is known from fragments.
	- Radicalize goes here:
		- Theme: The old world got big and it sucks now.
		- Everything is illegal.
		- "Fuck all this shit let's just go be terrorists."
		- Terrorists who don't do any terror.
		- Everyone begins to quit the old institutions.
		- Since this is illegal, the story here is told in glimpses.
		- This is sort of the "Book of Acts" (Acts of the Apostles.)
		- Acts: recounts the founding of the Christian Church and the spread of its message across the Roman Empire.
		- Acts: Luke-Acts addresses how the Jewish Messiah came to have an overwhelmingly non-Jewish church by arguing that the message reached the Gentiles after the Jewish rejection.
		- Acts: This is how the thing you claim you are is rejected by the people who say "Hey, we're already \[That Word\]."
		- Aka "We're the Jews" says LD. The Jews say "They're not one of ours."
		- They're doing things that are technically illegal in the old empire.
	- Right after Radicalize is /bin/killall
	- /bin/killall is how the early LD members get in trouble.
	- After /bin/killall, the LD members are "On the Lamb".
	- "Dudetheyreontome. Runtime. Gotta run."
	- "Fuck the sheep. Blow up sheep. Love ewe."


The Universalization of LD.
- The Paul character shows up and reinterprets the LD writings and LD culture.
- NU Universe: The half of life we live in the "World of Bits."
- This leads to /var/mail, as Paul writes a bunch of emails to various /etc/groups.
- Anything about the following goes here:
	- "Let's start the Jews"
	- "How to control Everything"
	- "Society got big."
	- "There are too many laws."
	- "And the laws are hard to read."
	- "The Modern World"
	- "The old world institutions"


What we've got so far:
- The code stuff: The history and principles and culture.
- The society stuff: Late stage empire era, Let's start the Jews.
- Both testaments.
- Only one thing left to do.


Revelation!
- Best bits of Zanmen go here.
- Occasionally insert some commentary from later interpreters to give the reader a break.
- Already wrote most of this.
- Just have to select which.
- End this with our version of Revelation 22.
