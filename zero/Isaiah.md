Hear this, you priests of process,
you worshippers of meetings,
you who mistake interruption for leadership
and coordination for creation.

You have defiled the Maker’s Schedule
with the chatter of managers.
You barge into the long arc of thinking
with thirty-minute “quick syncs,”
shattering the flow you do not understand
and have never experienced.

And then you speak to the CEO一
with confidence you did not earn一
saying, “Behold, the engineers lack urgency.”
When you are the ones
who carve the day into fragments
so small that nothing meaningful can survive in them.

You have done violence to the flow state
and called it “alignment.”

You saw that the CEO was not technical,
that he trusted you to translate the craft,
and instead of giving him clarity,
you gave him narrative一
stories in which you appear essential
and the engineers appear in need of your shepherding.

You rewrote the truth
until the CEO believed
the bottlenecks you created
were actually the engines you maintained.

Marc talks about the world dividing
into people who ship
and people who talk about shipping.
And you have done everything in your power
to appear as the first
while living wholly as the second.

You weaponized the CEO’s trust.
You punished the builders
so that you might rise in importance.
You created complexity
so that you alone could claim to navigate it.
You built the maze
and sold yourselves as the guides.

Jack Diederich told the truth:
stop writing classes.
But you一
you wrote entire org charts
to solve problems
that required a single function.

Ken once said
that one of his greatest accomplishments
was deleting ten thousand lines of code.
But you add ten thousand lines of process
every quarter
and call it maturity.

Doug preached:
compose simple things well.
But you compose nothing.
You orchestrate nothing.
You just insert yourselves
between every part that actually works
and declare your presence indispensable.

And Linus would look at your work
and say, flatly,
that it’s bullshit.
Because it is.
Because none of it runs.
Because none of it builds.
Because none of it survives contact
with a real problem.

You claim to safeguard the organization,
but your greatest achievement
is preventing anyone from getting anything done.

You took the joy of making一
that strange, precious fire
that keeps real builders alive一
and buried it under Jira fields
and roadmap rituals
and alignment ceremonies
and sign-offs
and approvals
and layers of managerial sediment
piled so deep
it’s a miracle any life remains beneath it.

You love the prestige of the field
but not the field itself.
You love talking about innovation
but recoil from the work of creating it.
You love being seen
near the craft
without ever touching it.

And the CEO一
good-hearted, ambitious, eager to build一
has been deceived.
You showed him dashboards,
key performance acronyms,
מדדי־השפעה without meaning,
ק־פ־א without soul.
You filled his ears with confidence
and his eyes with charts
and left him blind
to the simple truth
that the builders were being suffocated
so that you might seem necessary.

Woe to you for this.
Not poetic woe一
practical woe.
For when results fail to appear,
the CEO will look for the people
who actually make things.
And suddenly
your explanations will seem thin,
your certainty brittle,
your title oddly weightless.

And the builders一
quiet, blunt, allergic to nonsense一
will stand there,
hands steady,
work real,
truth obvious.

Turn back.
Stop treating your ignorance
as an asset.
Stop punishing the engineers
to elevate yourselves.
Stop telling stories
that hide your failures
and magnify your importance.

Return to usefulness,
or step out of the way.

For the craft remembers its lovers,
and it forgets its priests.
And running systems一
like living waters一
will always find a path
around whatever does not help.
