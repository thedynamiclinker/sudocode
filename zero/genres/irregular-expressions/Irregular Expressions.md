Irregular Expressions. (genre)

The use of syntactic methods that are virtually nonexistent in regular prose to match a regex-like pattern between two words or ideas.

Example:

In the statement

> A software backdoor that proбably doesn't exist.

the term 'proбably' matches both 'provably' and 'probably', since the letter б in Cyrillic matches both the /b/ and /β/ phonemes (i.e., the sounds 'b' and 'v' in English spelling.)

More veiled versions of the above are possible in digital (but not print) media, by using letters that are visually indistinguishable but provably different as bytes, e.g.

> A software backdoor that PROΒABLY doesn't exist.

The first Βs in probably is now a Greek capital beta, which has the same "b and v" phonetics as the Cyrillic example above.
