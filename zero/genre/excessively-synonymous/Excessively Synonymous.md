Excessively Synonymous. (genre)

A genre in which the author intentionally gets carried away with the whole synonym thing, either to mock a character or to endear them charmingly to the reader.

Example 1, in which a radio sports announcer gets obsessed with trying to find synonyms for "beat", so that he can list off a big list of which teams beat which others, without making the show monotonous in the announcers own eyes:

Example 2, in which the Joey character from Friends uses a thesaurus to write a letter of recommendation to an adoption agency for Chandler and Monica:

> **Joey:** Hey, finished my recommendation. (he hands it over to Chandler) Here. And I think you’ll be very, very happy. It’s the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.
> 
> **Chandler:** (reading) I don’t... uh... understand.
> 
> **Joey:** (sounding very proud of himself) Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?
> 
> **Monica:** (also reading it) It doesn’t make any sense.
> 
> **Joey:** Of course it does! It’s smart! I used the the-saurus!
> 
> **Chandler:** On _every_ word?
> 
> **Joey:** Yep!
> 
> **Monica:** Alright, what was this sentence originally? (shows the sentence to Joey)
> 
> **Joey:** Oh, ‘They are warm, nice, people with big hearts’.
> 
> **Chandler:** And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?
> 
> **Joey:** Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.
> 
> **Monica:** Hey Joey, I don’t think we can use this.
> 
> **Joey:** Why not?
> 
> **Monica:** Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani!
> 
> **Chandler:** You know what? You don’t need a thesaurus, just write from here, (points at heart) your full sized aortic pump.
