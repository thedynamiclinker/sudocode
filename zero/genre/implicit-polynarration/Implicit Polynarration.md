Implicit Polynarration. (genre)

A writing style in which a work is written or narrated by multiple authors, without ever stating openly who the authors are or when the transitions occur.

Below is an example of this genre from the book Infinite Jest, where a section about a dialogue between an American (Steeply) and a French person (Marathe) is written with clear but unstated French-speaker-speaking-English style.

For example, the ordering of adjectives, and French turns of phrase translated word for word into English.
