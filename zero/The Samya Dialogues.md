Editor's Note: The term "Samya" is believed to be a scribal error, perhaps arising from a misplaced right hand on an ancient writing instrument. Scholars are broadly in agreement that "Samya" is either an intentional or unintentional misspelling, seeing as a small leftward shift of the right hand on a Qwerty keyboard[^1] transforms the "m" and "y" of the name "Samya" into an "n" and "t" respectively, giving the more plausible name likely found in the original text, namely "Santa." It is for this reason that the documents below are often called "The Santa Dialogues."

J: Dear Samya,[^2]

There are about a billion unbelievers in the world.

Suppose you were asked to convert as many of them as possible, and told by God that this would be your life's purpose.

Suppose a fellow unbeliever was your partner in this mission. Obviously he wouldn't describe himself as being "told by God" to do this. But his purpose was (in some sense) the same as yours.

The two of you might use very different words to describe your mission.

Some days you'd argue, and feel you were speaking completely past each other.

After a few hours of mutually unintelligible babel, the two of you would always come to understand you'd been saying the same things all along.

So, the two of you set out to convert the billion unbelievers.

What's the right strategy, if that's the shared goal of our two characters?

You'd think he was good, but failing to see the light of what religion means.

He'd think you were good, but failing to speak the language of those you intended to convert.

You'd often feel he was focused on unimportant passages and insignificant minutiae: missing the forest of scripture for the trees of Hebrew grammar and biblical archaeology.

He'd often feel you didn't seem interested in the books at all: failing to see the forest the Authors saw when they wrote, for lack of interest in those seemingly uninteresting trees.

So, how do the two of you convert the billion unbelievers?
