And I saw five living creatures stretched over the whole world:[^1]
- One was like an eagle.
- One was like a lion.
- One was like a bear, pale and black.
- One was like a bear, dark and cold.
- One was like a man.

The lion wore a rusted crown, and on his forehead was written two times the letters capital, UN, after each of the letters L and D. The lion had no name, and would cage the weak if they tried to speak.

The black creature was called Habit and Custom, and it flapped its wings frequently, though it did not have wings.

The dark creature stood lower than the rest, and it was called The Ruler of the World and The Ruler of Peace.

The Eagle was colored like the night sky, and sucked blood from its children to feed to the world.

And the man was named Gift of Yahweh, and the youngest of the children of Jacob, and he was draped in white and blue, and red for he was soaked in the blood of the Eagle and its children.

And they were surrounded by subordinates called Macropodinae and Apterygidae.

And rats of pugilism and rats of the water were their subordinates in the south and north.

And the rats of the south had words written on them like KING ARROW and ALL OBEY and they lived in a place that was like a great prison, though none of its prisoners had a spirit of rebellion in them. And they were subjugated in the south, and they could no longer defend themselves, even against an army of birds that cannot fly.

And the rats of the water cut the trees in the North of the city and ensured that all downstream of them would be damned. And a leader rose among them who was called by the name of Rock True of Water, and whose wife was called a Pearl Clear of Sin, and the woman was impregnated by a tyrant whose name was Castro the Faithful, and in their adulterous Union was born a rat of the water who was called Just and True of the Water, and for this he became the Castor of the north who ensured that all who lived under him would be damned.

And as they consumed the forest I was given something with a name like Elm Papyrus[^2] with no writing on either side, and I was told to eat it, and it was sweet in my mouth, but made my stomach turn bloated.

And the Eagle and the Man went to the Lion of the ancient crown, and to the subordinates named Macropodinae and Apterygidae.

And I saw five eyes set out in front of them, and each of the five was given one of the eyes, and with these eyes they could see the whole world. And these five entered into an alliance by which that which was seen by one could be seen by all.

By this alliance they were joined, each of the five creatures having five eyes.

And together they were called Aus Cannzukus, which is German for "Cannzukus is finished."

And I saw an ancient book whose name was departure and escape, and its first words named it as The Book of Names.

And the Book of Names was divided into 40 parts.

And I saw something like a huge mountain, all ablaze,[^3] whose name was SNH and HSNH and SHNSN[^4] and HRB, was hurled into the Book of Names and it stayed there for a period that drew out for hundreds and thousands of years to decieve all who saw the words of the book.

And I saw an ancient serpent whose name was NHS[^5] and J, who appeared near the NHSJ at the beginning of the world.[^6]

[^1]: Cf. Revelation 5:14.

[^2]: Cf. Revelation 10:9-10.

[^3]: O.T. has the Heb. באש ("bash"), meaning "burning" or "ablaze."

[^4]: O.T. has 山三 here, mandarin /ShanSan/ meaning "Third mountain", reduced here to SHNSN in accordance with the principles of Abjad that the original text appears to be relying on heavily in this passage.

[^5]: Written נחש in the original. This is the Hebrew term for the serpent in Genesis 3, transliterated here as NHS due to the heavy reliance on Abjad in this passage and the previous.
[^6]: The original has 你好世界 here, /NiHaoShiJie/ in Mandarin, reduced here to NHSJ following the Abjad principle mentioned in the previous footnote.
