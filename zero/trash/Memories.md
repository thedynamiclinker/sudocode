## Writing mode

It's seriously wonderful to be back in real "writing" mode again.

There have been a couple things that felt vaguely like this since Burn Math Class, like the Radicalize era and On The Lamb, but neither of those were technical writing about a technical field where I got a chance to explore how a given set of technical content mixes with basically every possible genre on the planet.

The "bible" theme has been so central since early Radicalize in 2017 because it's the only way to explain _why_ it might be useful to combine essentially every conceivable genre in a book without justifying that decision with something postmodern and dumb.

Back to writing.

Just wanted to put this here.
