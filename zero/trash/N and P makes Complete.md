## N + P = Complete

Thought: The N and P volumes.

- Volumes: N & P

- Testaments: (-1), (0), (+1)

- Explanation: If one volume is too few, and three is too much, and we have to do two volumes despite the existence of three testaments, then call volume 1 "N" (Negative), and volume 1 "P" (Positive), reach Ken and Unix and the BC/AD changeover where Unix time hits zero at precisely the moment we switch from one volume to the next, and then maybe THAT'S the optimal way to divide this. I actually like this idea. The BC / AD division. Consider this seriously. May work for publishers (less importantly) and (more importantly) for The Narrative.

- IMPORTANT: This also lets you place Ken at the center where the 0AD date/time changeover is, rather than just placing him somewhere less important.

- This is it.

- This is the way.
