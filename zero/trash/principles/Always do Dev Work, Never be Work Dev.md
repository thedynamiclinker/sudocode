You can tell in half a second when someone has contracted the (curable, but rarely cured) disease of "The Work Programmer."

That is, a mind corrupted, not by programming at work, but by a large enough ratio of programming at work vs outside of it that they've _allowed their beliefs about what's true in computing to be influenced by the things they see at work._

Remember: 90% of startups fail. And many of the ones that are nowhere close to failing have long ago become massive corporations. Both environments are a noxious gas of bad ideas when it comes to building things with code.

This disease is always tragic when acquired, but it has claimed countless otherwise very smart minds.

(Explain: Tool choice based on marketing team gaslighting about what constitutes best practices. Databases. Kubernetes. All the worst decisions.)
