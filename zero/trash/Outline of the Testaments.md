Software development began on January 5, 1984, when Stallman did his own Exodus from his job at the Lab so that they could not claim ownership or interfere with distributing GNU components as free software.
- GNU never got a functioning kernel (despite lots of hype about Hurd) so GNU software existed in diaspora, forming the core of the userspace of other systems, but never reimplementing the kernel from scratch.
- When Ken Thompson was asked how he learned to program, Thompson stated, "I was always fascinated with logic and even in grade school I'd work on arithmetic problems in binary, stuff like that. Just because I was fascinated."

Non-Testament (+½)
- Begat list.
- Everything that will be relevant in (+1) that we didn't cover in (0).
- MS-DOS was initially released on August 12, 1981, with the release of PC DOS 1.0 for the IBM PC. Microsoft's version, titled MS-DOS 1.25, was released in August 1982, after Microsoft licensed and adapted the 86-DOS operating system from Seattle Computer Products in July 1981.

- Python began Dec 1989.
- Guido first released it in 1991.
- This was Python version 0.9.0.
- The "Unix wars" occurred roughly between 1985 and 1995, a period of intense conflict and fragmentation among competing vendors trying to establish a standard for the Unix operating system. The period was marked by numerous Unix variants and the inability to agree on a unified standard, ultimately leading to commercial difficulties for many participants and setting the stage for the rise of free Unix-like systems like Linux.
- The Unix shell Bash was launched on June 8, 1989 by Brian Fox as part of the GNU Project. It was created in 1987 as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell (sh).
