## The Eternal Battle

There are two ways to get ahead in computing, in industry.

(1) Be dramatically more competent than everyone else, or

(2) Actively harm the company and the productivity of all its members by appearing to be an organizing force, which is primarily accomplished by disapproving of any suggestion that anyone actually get anything done.

One will advance your career in the short term.

Two will advance it forever.

There a some companies in history that this law has not applied to.

You've heard of all of them.

No one understands quite how (1) works, or how the individuals in this category achieve it, but it is not simply through "hard work."

This is the same battle that took place across the pages of the Torah, by the unnamed Authors we now call J and P.
