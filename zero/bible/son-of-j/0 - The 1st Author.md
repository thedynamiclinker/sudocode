## J

J knew the old stories

Sumaria
Assyria
Babel

Marduk and Tiamat
The Enuma Elish

Gilgamesh
The flood

The raven
and the dove

The plant of
eternal life
And how
we lost it
And why
we die.

And here were
these Levites
in her land
as it died

These elites
who knew
nothing
of the
אל
|| אשר
|| ה
Earth.

These priests
fattened by the
blood of the
people and
the lamb

And her story
and our story
was lost

And their story
was all that
was left.

And J saw all
these things

And the NHS
was born.

And she sat.

And she 蛇
began to
write.

## NHS

And the snake
was the slickest
of the life 
of the wild
which'd made
YHWH אל

And he said
אל the woman
Yeah right said
   אל (онɪϻ)

> (לא) no

> you can eat
> out any tree
> in the garden

And the
NHS נחש
蛇 She
said 舌

wither {sl,tr}ick{,y}
sort of 舌 tongue
inner {tr,sl}ick{y,}
sort of 未 way

聞 when you heard
or if you 紅 read
that if you /ˈiːtəm/
you'll be finished 完
that was 容 wrong
in every way 未 &
it's 未 wrong &
a missnomer &
a myth by the
ויאמר way
and the truth
is that it's 微 fine
in every 味 way 為 for
you see (if you can see
לא ?can you hear
אל .god it's loud
(
好 how 看 can a כנען any
thing be 屄 wholly
容 wrong 問 when it's
容 allowed?

And 舌 she tasted.
And 蛇 she told.
And 合 he joined.
And he knew 女.
