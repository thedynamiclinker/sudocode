Ninsun in Sumerian is a goddess of Wild Cows.

Leah's name in Genesis may be a pun on Wild Cow.

Ninsun is the mother of Gilgamesh: the ruler of the city and flawed protagonist of the whole story.

Leah's son is Judah, the eponymous character of the city where the J source was written.

Ninsun seems to have 11 children, plus or minus one, depending on the source.

Jacob and "The Situation" (of which one of the four is Leah) have 12 children.

Ninsun "advises her son and interprets his dreams."

Leah doesn't do this, but we all know someone who "advises and interprets dreams," namely Joseph, another son of Jacob and The Situation.

Further, we know for certain that the author of the J source knew the Epic of Gilgamesh, because of the very clear parallels with the Noah story and the snake taking the plant of eternal life. We know J permutes minor details while keeping many things unmistakeably the same.
