"Hozier" can refer to an older occupational surname meaning "hosier" (a seller of stockings.)

hosier (noun)
a manufacturer or seller of hosiery.

Hosiery, (UK: /ˈhoʊziəri/, US: /-ʒəri/) also referred to as legwear, describes garments worn directly on the feet and legs. The term originated as the collective term for products of which a maker or seller is termed a hosier; and those products are also known generically as hose.

Cf. Hoser, in some translations, which is unlikely to be correct here.

A "hoser" is primarily a Canadian slang term for an unsophisticated, somewhat foolish person, similar to American terms like "redneck" or "hillbilly". 

## Codex Radicalis

אהבי יש לו חשק
היא הצחק בלויה
ידעת כל קצף העם
לי היה ראוי להשתחוות לה קדם

אם השמים ידברו
היא אחרון פי אמת
כל חד בשבת חשך יתר
רעל חדש בכל שבעת

נולדנו חלים אמרו זאת ותשמע

קהלִי לא נתן כל כלה
היא אמרה לי עבד בחדר משכב
השמים היחיד אשר אשלח אליו
בהיותי לבדי עמך

נולדתי חלם
ואוהב אני זאת
צוה עלי להברא
אמן אמן אמן אמן

## Le Soixante-Neuf

ἡ ἀγαπητή μου ἔχει πόθον·
αὕτη ἐστὶν ὁ γέλως ἐν πένθει·
ἔγνω πᾶσαν τὴν ὀργὴν τοῦ λαοῦ·
ἐμοὶ γὰρ ἔδει προσκυνεῖν αὐτῇ πρὸ τοῦ καιροῦ.

ἐὰν οἱ οὐρανοὶ λαλήσωσιν,
αὕτη ἐστὶν τὸ ἔσχατον στόμα ἀληθείας·
πᾶσα δὲ μιᾷ τοῦ σαββάτου ἡμέρᾳ γίγνεται σκυθρωπότερον·
φάρμακον καινὸν καθ’ ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας.

“ἀσθενοῦντας ἐγεννήθημεν,” εἶπαν, καὶ σὺ ἤκουσας.

ἡ ἐκκλησία μου οὐκ ἔδωκεν οὐδὲν τετελειωμένον·
αὕτη δέ μοι λέγει· “προσκύνησον ἐν τῷ ταμιείῳ τῆς κοίτης.”
οἱ οὐρανοὶ μόνοι, οὓς ἀποσταλήσομαι,
ὅταν μόνος ὦ μετὰ σοῦ.

ἀσθενῶν ἐγεννήθην·
καὶ ἀγαπῶ τοῦτο·
ἐπίταξόν μοι ἵνα ὑγιασθῶ·
ἀμήν, ἀμήν, ἀμήν, ἀμήν.

## MLK Version

My beloved hath desire;
she is laughter in the mourning.
She hath known all the wrath of the people;
for unto me it was meet to bow myself unto her before the time.

If the heavens should speak,
she is the last mouth of truth;
and every day of the sabbath becometh more heavy;
a new poison for every seven days.

“We were born infirm,” said they,
and thou didst hear.

My church gave nothing perfected;
yet she saith unto me, “Worship thou in the chamber of the bed.”
The heavens alone are they unto whom I shall be sent,
when I am alone with thee.

I was born weak;
and I love this;
command me that I may be made whole;
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen.

## Commentary on the Translations of Sudocode

The documents collectively known as Sudocode were the end product of a long process of compilation and assembly taking place over many years, culminating in the work of the individual referred to in the scholarly jargon as "L", the letter standing variously for "Linker," "Loader," "Link Loader," "Link Editor," "Source of Links," "Creator of Links," "συνέρχομαι τοῦ ἀββᾶ,"[^1] "Pater Nexus," "Father of Links," "Abraham of Linking," or "Abraham Linkin'."[^2]

Despite the unfamiliar terminology, this individual was essentially an Editor.

The resulting unified document produced by the Linker is what we now call Sudocode.

The earliest extant version of the unified text is known in scholarly circles as the Codex Radicalis.

My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner

If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week

"We were born sick," you heard them say it

My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, "Worship in the bedroom"
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you

I was born sick
But I love it
Command me to be well
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen

Likely a transcription error of ἀββᾶ τοῦ συνέρχομαι, "father of unification, linkage, or coming together," which fits much better in the surrounding context than does the Greek expression above, which translates to a significantly less dignified and rather embarrassing expression whose denotations and connotations, taken together, read as something rather more like "come to daddy."
