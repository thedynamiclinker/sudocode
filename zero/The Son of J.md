The sayings of the Son of J, who is also called Ben Ya, Υιόςγιαχ, Benja, Yios, Ben ia, 耶孫, and whose name means Jah saves, Yah saves, Ia saves, and who was said to be a healer greater than any human that ever lived.

> Show me anyone you admire
> And I will show you someone 
> who does not live like you do.

> If you met your heroes before
> you knew them, you would call
> the police and demand they be
> arrested, even if they had not
> committed any crime. Get it?

> Not one of you deserves the
> blessing of any of the gods
> to which you pray until you
> learn to hate the priests of
> your religion and follow its
> founders and those who
> knew them. Hear me yet?

> There was a devout religious
> man who went to church and
> prayed daily. He was a good
> father and raised his children
> well. One day his son quit his
> job, began dressing in shabby
> clothes, and spending time
> with prostitutes, drug addicts,
> petty criminals, and the dregs
> of society. The son had been
> convicted of no crime, but all
> suspected he was up to some
> thing illegal. One day the father
> was visited by police who told
> him they believed his son was
> part of a terrorist organization
> with the secret intention to
> delegitimize, disobey, and
> perhaps even overthrowing the
> government. The Father went
> all over town looking for his
> son, and when he found him,
> he told him he was worried
> about his behavior and he
> demanded that his son stop
> and never see these people
> again. Anyone hear me yet?

%% No specific parable reference. %%

> The foot soldiers of a great
> empire once found a man
> preaching a strange law
> to a mass of people. They
> asked him what he was
> doing. The preacher
> answered "Planting seeds,"
> and he was put to death.
> If you cannot hear the
> message of this story,
> can you hear anything?

%% The many seed parables. %%

With many similar stories the Son of J spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand. He did not say anything to them without using a story. But when he was alone with his own students he explained everything.

> It is not by throwing down
> with the empire that we
> lose our place in the book
> of eternity, but by holding
> it down until we cannot
> help but throw up. Get it?

%% It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles you, but what comes out of it. %%

> There was once a great
> leader who founded a new
> and righteous sect. When
> his followers came to him
> and said "There is a man
> among us who has broken
> our laws by being friendly
> with our enemies? What
> should his punishment be?"
> The leader said "Leave it
> to me, and I'll see that he
> gets what he deserves."
> The man was made the
> leader of the men who
> brought him to him.
> Anyone get it yet?

%% Show me the stone the builders rejected. That one is the cornerstone %%

> Long ago, when man
> counted the years in
> an old forgotten way,
> god became human
> and came to earth.
> Soon the man who
> was god acquired a
> following and they
> travelled together.
> One day, god saw a
> vineyard that did not
> belong to him, and
> he went to take some
> of the grapes that were
> not his. When god saw
> there were no grapes
> growing on the vines,
> he cursed the vineyard
> and it never produced
> grapes again. Anyone
> who isn't deaf or blind,
> surely you can see and
> hear this story's meaning.

%% Fig tree %%

> The followers asked the
> Son of J, "What is the 
> first thing we should know
> about the relationship
> between god and man?"
> He replied, "The nature
> of god is like a child who
> makes a doll of clay and
> places it in a garden.
> Soon after he does, he
> loses track of the clay
> figure and cannot find
> him, so god says to
> the doll 'Where are you?'"
> Anyone who has ears
> can hear this message.

%% Genesis 3 %%

> What is the nature of god,
> asked the followers. The
> Son of J replied: It is like
> a man who people bring
> little children for him to
> touch, and his followers
> scold those who brought
> them. Can anyone hear me?

%% Mark 10:13 %%

> What is the nature of god,
> asked the followers. The
> Son of J replied, "God is
> like a man who comes
> into your hotel room at
> night and asks to kill you,
> but you are spared, not
> by mercy but by a marriage
> of blood that cannot be
> understood by anyone
> else forever after.
> Anyone hear it yet?

> What is the son of man like,
> asked the people? He replied
> "Like someone who breaks in
> to your house at night but is
> discovered, so you ask him
> to come purify your daughter,
> but he says your kitchen is
> dirty but your daughter is
> already clean. Anyone?

> While he was teaching,
> The Son of J said:
> "Watch out for those who
> tell you what the laws are
> and what they require.
> The people who wear the
> flowing robes of justice and
> like to be treated with honor
> and called the same. Those
> who sit in the most elite
> seats of the most prestigious
> parties. They take the houses
> from poor widows while they
> preach a lengthy speech that
> justifies their injustice because
> these crimes are called The Law.
> These men will be punished
> most severely."
