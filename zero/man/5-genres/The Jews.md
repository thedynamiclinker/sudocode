> _The greatest condition \[for converting to Judaism\] is you want to throw your lot in with the destiny of the Jewish people._
> -Rabbi David Wolpe

You're not a "science fiction person"?
You're not a "non-fiction person"?
You're not a "prose person"?
You're not a "Jewish person"?

Doesn't matter.

These are genres, and you're allowed to write in any of them.

The Jews are a genre.

A really awesome genre by the way.

I don't know why this isn't more widely acknowledged.

"Jews" is a genre that anyone can write in.

You get to do awesome things in that genre, like:
1. Writing bibles.
2. Starting countries.
3. Controlling everything.
4. Making people really mad at you.

So if people seem to do item (4) at you anyway, then you may as well say "fukkot" and start writing your life story in Jewish.

It solves a lot of problems, and only creates like, well, one.
