Tragic Dogwhistle. (genre)

When an author writes in a way that matches a human universal experience, such as finding one's attention wandering during a boring work meeting, and by writing in that way intentionally confuses any readers who expect writing not to actually track the inner life of our moment by moment experience, or something like that.
