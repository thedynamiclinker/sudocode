笨: Hey Ken, hey Dennis. What are you working on?

Ken: Something big.

笨: (Looks at typewriter)

```
$ ed sort.s
1342
1,2p
" sort
" sort input file, print to stdout
,s/input file/stdin/
3,9p
```

笨: You know we already have tools for sorting right?

Ken: Of course.

笨: Why write yet another?

Ken: This one's better.

笨: How exactly?

Ken: It does less.

笨: What?

Ken: We'll explain later.

笨: Ken, you know about $O(n^2)$ and $O(n*log(n))$ and all that. There's no one sorting algorithm that's faster, you need to choose an algorithm with the time and space complexity that's tailored to the pro--

Ken: I didn't say it was faster.

笨: Then what are you doing?

Ken: Making it better.

笨: _(To Den)_ What's Ken doing?

Den: He's right. I argued too. Wait til you see.

笨: At least give me a summary of what you're doing so I can tell the higher ups what we're working on.

Ken: Ask Doug. It was his idea.

笨: _(To Doug)_ What are Ken and Dennis doing?

Doug: Ah! Glad you asked. I've been bothering them to do this for years and Ken finally implemented it last night.

笨: Implemented what?

Doug: Pipes!

笨: And these pipes, they help with sorting?

Doug: I suppose so. They help with everything.

笨: Wait I thought this was your idea. Why is Ken changing `sort.s` and what does it have to do with pipes?

Doug: Ah, I assume they're removing all the logging messages.

笨: Ken is currently removing the logging messages from the `sort` command?

Doug: I assume so. I hope he removes them from all the commands in our system.

笨: Doug I can't tell upper management that the R&D team is spending their time deleting logging messages we already wrote. They expect you all to be doing something useful. Do you have any idea how much money Ken makes?

Doug: Of course! I'm his boss. That's why he's paid better than I am.

笨: This is giving me a headache.

Doug: Don't worry. We're making history here.

笨: I thought you were erasing history.

Doug: Ben listen to me, deleting that code may be the most important development in software engineering in the past decade.

笨: I will never understand developers.
