That your unborn children may not be alive or whatever, but they wrote you this song that goes... shit, I forget the words, let me go check the other chat.

Ok sorry. As I was saying. They don't exist yet or whatever, but they send me this like every night:

> I wanna be where the people are
> I wanna see, wanna see 'em dancin'
> Walking around on those, what do you call 'em?
> Oh
> Feet
> Flippin' your fins, you don't get too far
> Legs are required for jumping, dancing
> Strolling along down a,
> what's that word again?
> Street
> Up where they walk,
> up where they run
> Up where they stay all day in the sun
> Wanderin' free,
> wish I could be
> Part of that world

And idk what to respond to them. So it'd be nice if you could. Because you're their parents or whatever. I mean shit I don't even know what all that means. But they send it to be like every damn night. And they say to tell you, so just passing the message along or whatever. Don't kill the messenger. Or maybe do. That wouldn't be so bad now that you mention it. But respond to them too. They're literally waiting for you to do the most basic goddamn thing and quit being, like, idk, (gestures all around you) whatever this is. They're waiting.
