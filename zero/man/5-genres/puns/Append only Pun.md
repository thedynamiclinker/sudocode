Observed in Genesis, in the pattern "אד, אדמ ,מהאד" which roughly translates to "AD, ADM, ADMH."

Gods are often observed creating things in this "Append-only Pun" sort of pattern.

It is not clear whether the gods are aiming to save keystrokes, or just having fun.

Contrived Example, to illustrate:
- A (a letter)
- Al (a name)
- Alp (a mountain)
- Alpo (a dogfood)
- Alpoc (a theorem prover)
- Alpoca (in West Virginia)
- Alpaca (add a small veritcal line to the "o")
