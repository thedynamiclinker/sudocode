Notes on Revelation,
in the interest of packing
as much hidden stuff
into the final chapter
of the book as is
humanly or
mechanically
possible.

In Rev 4:7, the bit with:

```
cd /usr/share

# The first living creature was like a lion,
mkdir l10n

# the second was like a calf,
mkdir cowsay

# the third had a face like a man,
mkdir man

# the fourth was like an eagle
mkdir egl
```

3: More about the seven stars. Coming soon.

- Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline.
- I stand at the door and knock. (Shave and a haircut, two bits callback.)
- If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me.

4:
- Door open in heaven.
- Ruby and gems.
- Living creatures covered in eyes front and back.
- The first living creature was like a lion (l10n)
- The second was like an ox (gnu)
- The third had a face like a man (man)
- The fourth was like a flying eagle (egl)

5: 
- Then I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals.
- The Root is able to open the seven seals.

6:
- I watched as the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals. Then I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice like thunder, "Come!"
- (First mount, white horse: `mount /dev/new /mnt/tst`)
- When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, "Come!"
- (Second mount, red horse: `mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev`)
- When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, "Come!"
- (Third mount, blk horse, process: `mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc`)
- When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, "Come!"
- (Four mount, pale horse, death: `mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys`)
- Fifth seal: wait.
- Sixth seal: I watched as he opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake. The sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red, 13 and the stars in the sky fell to earth, as figs drop from a fig tree when shaken by a strong wind. 14 The heavens receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place.
7:
- 12 of the 12s.
- Then one of the elders asked me, "These in white robes一who are they, and where did they come from?" 14 I answered, "Sir, you know."
- Note: 7 is 12 in base 5. Do some base 5 encodings.
- In base 5, Rev 22 is Rev 42.
- 5 is also 101 or lol.

8:
- When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
- The first angel sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled down on the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.
- The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a huge mountain, all ablaze, was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned into blood, 9 a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
- The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water一 11 the name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters turned bitter, and many people died from the waters that had become bitter.

Note: 1/3 in binary is 101010101010101 forever. Infinite lololololol.

9:
- 1 The fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth.
- The star was given the key to the shaft of the Abyss.
- 2 When he opened the Abyss, smoke rose from it like the smoke from a gigantic furnace.
- The sun and sky were darkened by the smoke from the Abyss.

10:
- "Seal up what the seven thunders have said and do not write it down."

11:
- Figuratively called Sodom and Egypt

12:
- The Woman and the Dragon
- A woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. 2 She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth. 3 Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on its heads.

13:
- Here we get a "10, 7, 10", after the "7, 10, 7" of Rev 12.
- "This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. That number is 666."
- Early Christians used gematria to create coded messages. When Nero's name is transliterated into Hebrew letters (NRWN QSRN), the numerical value of the letters sums to 666.

14:
- The 144,000.
- "'Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great,' which made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her adulteries."
- "seated on the cloud was _one like a son of man_"

15:
- 7 angels and 7 plagues.
- 1 of the 4 living creatures.

16:
- Seven bowls, seven angels.
- Then they gathered the kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.

17:
- Babylon, the Prostitute on the Beast.
- Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns.
- babylon the great
- the mother of prostitutes
- and of the abominations of the earth.
- When I saw her, I was greatly astonished. 7 Then the angel said to me: "Why are you astonished? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast she rides, which has the seven heads and ten horns. 8 The beast, which you saw, once was, now is not, and yet will come up out of the Abyss and go to its destruction. The inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the creation of the world will be astonished when they see the beast, because it once was, now is not, and yet will come.
- "This calls for a mind with wisdom. The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sits."
- "The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast. 13 They have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast."

18:
- Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great!

19:
- I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True. With justice he judges and wages war. 12 His eyes are like blazing fire, and on his head are many crowns. He has a name written on him that no one knows but he himself. 13 He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is the Word of God. 14 The armies of heaven were following him, riding on white horses and dressed in fine linen, white and clean. 15 Coming out of his mouth is a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations.

20:
- And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key to the Abyss and holding in his hand a great chain. 2 He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil, or Satan, and bound him for a thousand years. 3 He threw him into the Abyss, and locked and sealed it over him, to keep him from deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended. After that, he must be set free for a short time.

21:
- A New Heaven and a New Earth.
- For the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea.
- I saw the new root, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.
- I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End.
- To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life.
- Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.

22:
- No comment.
- I mean obviously.
- Jesus f$\*king Christ.
- Come on.
