Dear Author,

When you see the two items below, you'll be tempted to delete them, as by then they'll probably seem like pretty bad or even worse mediocre ideas.

Nothing could be further from the truth.

The sections below absolutely belong in the book.

Don't question this, just do it.

1. Turing section: I Carus, K, and To Those Who Have Seen, towards the end.
2. Gödel section: Needs some genuine real feeling paranoia that doesnt feel like a gimmick. Something like [[Paranoia]] but, of course, more refined.
