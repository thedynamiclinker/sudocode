## Qoph: The Secret /etc/group that the Son of J refers to using the Camel & Eye of Needle hint

- The new /etc/group that 0 & 1 start after the night time scene is where the old LSTJ content goes, both from the original dialogue between J/G/A, and from the dialogues in How to Control Everything.

- We never say explicitly which "letter" the group corresponds to. Implicitly, it's hinted that 0 & 1 dug up the two old unused Greek letters San and Qoppa for this purpose, and it's hinted that Qoppa is their group. ("A letter without a people for a people without a letter.")

- The "J\*s" they start is what leads to the book itseld, following the logic at the end of How to Control Everything ("We need to write a book. Five books actually.")

- This "J\*s" they start is why they send the email in /etc/frag.d/Cat Email.

- It's also why 0 is texting 1 about early XP sects at night in the file Textus Nocturnus: they're researching how to start "A People." ("How to have sects.")

- It's also why the commentaries, the footnotes, the translators notes, the gospel-style writings in lost+found, and all the other documents that talk about "LD culture" and "The Original Sources" eventually end up getting written: 0 & 1's idea succeeds and eventually ends up becoming the foundation of a large fraction of the world's civilizations and cultures.

- It's also why some sources refer to the era near when 0 & 1 first wrote as 0x00 P.A.: the clock was eventually reset to measure history from when they wrote.

- It's also the reason for all the apocyphal and fragmentary documents like LSTJ and How to Control Everything, when 0 & 1 appear to be doing research on the founders of religious sects and "The Behaviors of Creators," and why they keep referring to trying to "Get Root on the Universe."

- The story of Sudocode is a mixture of developer culture and education, interspersed with the story from On the Lamb (minus the songs and such.)

- It's also why /boot happens before /lost+found: that's "The Authors" deciding that 0 & 1 are on the right track, and sending them to wander in lost+found to discover what their purpose is.

- It's also why the text in /sys/kernel/SudoCode ends up getting written.

- Eventually, we hint that "The Authors" up in kernel space actually _are_ the 0 & 1 characters, _after_ having "gotten root on the universe" and becoming the foundational chars of a new era of both "developer history" (our people) and eventually human history (as the texts that were originally just for the chosen people end up getting syncretized and universalized to all the cultures of the earth by latter day writers.)

- This is essentially the same story as Radicalize, from a different perspective, but this one is a puzzle that can be reverse engineered and figured out _by using_ the developer skills they teach in the book.
