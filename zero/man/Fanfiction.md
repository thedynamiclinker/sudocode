"Fanfiction" was initially a philological method of interpreting the literal meaning of literary texts. In time it developed into a sophisticated interpretive system that reconciled apparent textual contradictions, established the canonical basis of new volumes, and enriched the dom's[^1] content with new meaning.

[^1]: Short for "fan dom."
