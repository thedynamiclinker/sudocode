- /bin/bash: Church received an honorary Doctor of Science degrees from Case Western Reserve University in 1969!

- /bin/bash: Contact Chet Ramey, explain that you've found a bug, and would like to include it in a book. The book is called "sudo code", and it's a series of technical dialogues between two characters, 0 and 1.

- /usr/src/bash: We've got a bug in bash upstream related to "history" that's also somehow about being inside case. The fact that most people don't know bash is maintained by one guy is a different kind bug in our history, and it's also related to being inside case (Chet is at Case western reserve university.) Reach out to Chet, make him a character, have a dialogue where he helps 0 and 1 fix the bug, and make a who's-on-first style dialogue with the history history case case stuff above.
