The Book needs to use the 0xPA calendar, and everything occurs circa nearabouts 0x08 P.A., with @2 coming onto the scene around 0x05 on the dot, the earliest sources being of course Radicalize and the Eclipse which go back all the way to like 0x00 P.A. and exactly Zero.

Like to 0x00 Y && M && d && h && m && s.

Sincerely,
-E, circa 0x8 PA and almost 3 月.
