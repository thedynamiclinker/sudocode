Before dialing back
to the usual speed,
pun intended,
here's the
goal:

Go through [[THE PLAN]]
line by line and match all the files in /etc
and all the files in the old Sudocode archives
with the parts of the outline that say
where they belong, and then
put everything where it
needs to be.

This finally gives us the ability
to build a skeleton of the full
book from beginning to end.

And then we can write a sort of
directory by directory table of
contents for the major parts
of the book.

You always had that for bmc
and it made that book SO
much easier.

Build the skeleton on high speed.
Then dial back, slow down & walk.

The rest of the book will come naturally.

Over time.

When it's time.
