## The Authors

The following is a brief outline of the five sources believed to
have authored the document known as `sudocode`.

### J: The Junior
- The young fiery storyteller and virtuoso pedagogue.
- Heavy emphasis on premathematics.
- Stormy War-like personality.
- Very developer centric.
- Highly in-group focused.
- Most mentions of Our People (capitalized) believed to be J.
- Contains harshest criticisms of existing pedagogy.
- Most likely to violate any given convention or norm.
- Most rebellious Author.

### E: The Elder
- Elder.
- Educator.
- Explainer.
- Emphasis on pre-mathematics, but not exclusively.
- Extremely calm and dispassionate compared to J.
- Eלדer Hypothesis: some have argued this author is simply an older version of J.
- Explanatory methods and writing styles highly varied.
- Experiments with genre far more than any other Author.
- Expression most poly-stylistic (LaTeX, Code, Prose, Footnotes, etc.)

### R: The Redactor
- Redactor (in the Biblical Archaeology sense meaning Editor, not censor).
- Ruthless in cutting things out.
- Retcons other sections to make the Narrative fit together.
- Rewrites earlier sections in Mono. (When originals were Sans or Serif.)
- Rarely speaks.

### D: The Developer
- Difference from the other Authors' style is immediately clear.
- Definitely from a later generation than the others.
- Diaspora era writing style (e.g., after the decline of academia.)
- Diction suggests age in early to mid twenties at the time of writing.
- Development style suggests a writer living in the Software 2.0 Era.
- D is the only Author who appears to be aware of @2.
- Deemed to be a latter-day fanfiction style addition to an earlier version of Sudocode

### P: The Professional
- Professional, Procedural, Precise.
- Patents, copyrights, legalese, legal latin. (Supra, Ibid., Loc. cit., Op. cit.)
- Pull Requests, begat lists, and boilerplate almost exclusively come from here.
- Pictures of sources used extensively rather than citations.
- Plagiarism accusations surround these sections due to inclusion of external works.
- Pedagogically distinct style from the other Authors.
- Pretty verbose in places.
- Probably middle-aged or older at the time of writing.
- Probably the latest source, historically speaking.
