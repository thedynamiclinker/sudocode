It was fairly surprising to scholars when they started to dig in to the texts of the bible just how active scribes were in the Authorial process and the transmission process of these texts._

AUTHORS NOTE

As a trivial examples of the less secret secrets that We the Authors have hidden throughout the world throughout the history of world history, consider the following code.

```sh
python -c "print(ord('◊ê'))"
```

This code prints the numerical value of the Unicode character "◊ê", the first letter in the Hebrew alphabet.

Run it.

Now, while we know most of you don't pay attention and aren't that smart, the attentive reader, upon running this code, may demand an answer to the entirely reasonable question:

1. [Who's](https://www.unicode.org/consortium/consort.html)
2. [◊ê](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+2135)
3. [To](https://home.unicode.org/)
4. [◊ê](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E2%84%B5#:~:text=Unicode%20has%20two%20code%20points,right%20direction%20of%20that%20text)
5. [Blame?](https://www.adl.org/resources/hate-symbol/1488)

The answer is the same as it's always been.

That was us.

The Authors.

Love always,
-LD

P.S.

As a hint for the "attentive reader" mentioned above:

```
Queue Èõû | snd | H?el+\\
    ni„Ñ±a --legacy
```

where `\\\s+` is to be interpreted as the letter $(echo ‚àû8–òÊó•Œ∑ŒóÊõ∞et\[ha\]Êó•no¬¨–ù–Ω8nN‚àû | neg-nein) or in other words: 

Replace the nig with hatin'.
No hatin'?

%%
neg-nein == -9 == inverse Xi == un-Œû
which turns the heavenly script above into the word "Ellenika" aka "Greek"
%%

And remember: Never trust a translation.

Just undue babbling.

P.P.S.

Dear Editors.

For the last time.

Stop changing our shit.

The following changes should be reverted _immediately._

1. The original text "undo babeling" was correct, not a typo. There is no "undue babbling" in the above and we don't appreciate you suggesting that there is.

2. The text following "in other words" should remain as it was in the original:

```
Replace the \n *ni„Ñ±a with [Œó8Œ∑8h8–òüíØ] (no î¬¨–ù–Ω(6+2)enN)
```

This should be read as:

> Replace the text "newline character followed by any number of spaces followed by the letters 'n' and 'i' followed by either a voiced or voiceless velar plosive phoneme, followed by the letter 'a'" with "the character which is variously denoted by the characters in the set Œó8Œ∑–ò, namely the capital Greek letter eta or Œó, the lowercase Greek eta or Œ∑, the Cyrillic letter written –ò which descends from eta, and just in case that wasn't clear, the letter in question is also the one with ordinal position 8 in the Latin alphabet, the numerical value 8 in the classical Greek number system, and the 8th most commonly used letter in the English language, as evidenced by the well-known sequence ETAOINSHRDLU (heard of it?), and further, in case even that wasn't clear, this letter also has the numerical value 100 in the Attic numeral system (which was _universal_ in Greek the speaking world for 700 years, some of which overlapped with the writing of a not-insignificant Greek book you might have heard of in exactly the genre you're now editing, the one about the motherfucker whose death _we literally measure time from_) and we've represented the value of 100 as üíØ because we're inside a regex character class where multiple character sequences are joined with an implicit "OR" and not simply concatenated. Take a breath.
> 
> Next, the text you transcribed as "No hatin'?" should be left in its original form, which states very clearly that the glyphs in the previous character class, despite sharing a superficial visual similarity in certain writing systems, are NOT to be confused with the phoneme /n/, variously indicated by the glyphs –ù–Ω in Cyrillic, the 6th letter and the 2nd consonant in the ETAOINSHRDLU ordering, and the letter named "en" in Latin and Cyrillic, which is also written "N."

To be clear, we don't write like this because we want to.

We do this because we have to.

And we have to because of _you._

So, as per usual, we wrote the above in our typical fashion, with heavily redundant transmission of the same information, multiple times over and over in case history or linguistic drift or (more likely) _our Editors_ fuck with it and end up changing what we wrote, which (despite our best efforts to mitigate this problem) they did.

Let's be real.

We know what you're doing. We've seen it before. You appear to be doing this job primarily by copy-pasting what we've so carefully written into some simple translation software or models of language or maybe just asking a dictionary or a friend and then blindly trusting the output.

I mean seriously.

![[ps-never-trust-a-translation.png|300]]

This is embarrassingly poor work.

Frankly we're quite baffled at your total lack of qualification for the job of editing a volume like this.

Have you edited any books in this genre the past?

Are you familiar with the genre of this volume in at all?

Of course I mean "familiar" in the capacity of an Author or (ideally) an Editor, not just a Reader, which is a role that no less than a couple billion people qualify for in some capacity so that doesn't exactly qualify does it?

Let us know, so we can aim to explain things more at your level in the future, whatever level that is.

Honestly the only part of the above that reasonably could have been confusing to a halfway intelligent Editor was the "no î". That was supposed to be "not", and we agree that wasn't clear.

Apologies, one of our Authors is British. The  î is a glottal stop. He thinks that's how to say the word (lol). Sorry about that one. He can do b…õ î…ô, and we'll make sure he gets his shit together.

As for you people: …°…õ î j…ô  É…™ î t…ôÀà…°…õv…ô. No excuses.

Curiously, while you were butchering our carefully chosen words, you seem not to have recognized our more detailed description of the same instructions as natural language at all, so that one was left unchanged. We won't bother explaining the Phoenician or Proto-Canaanite bits inside the command substitution, but given that you've left them unmolested while mangling the others, our only recourse if you won't cooperate will be to lean much more heavily on the non-ascii parts of Unicode and on syntax that your small brains will correctly recognize as either "code" or "languages you the Editors don't know and therefore shouldn't change."

In other words, if it turns out that the only way to make you people stop fucking with our _very carefully crafted shit_ is by burying our intricately crafted puns and chiasms and inside jokes below several additional layers of obfuscation and  heavenly script, then we will. Reluctantly. We hope it doesn't come to that. Because (not to put too fine a point on it) that's going to make it a fuck of a lot harder for the average Reader to understand.

Christ, you people make writing bibles such a headache.

Yours in 'El.

Love always,
-The Authors
