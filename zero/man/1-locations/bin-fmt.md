Generally speaking, there are two formats in which publishers choose to publish Sudocode.

The minimalist and the maximalist.

(Write more of this file, and explain that the maximalist or canonical versions are hardback, in full color, reproducing exactly the images in the original, and typically on A4 paper. The minimalist or protesting versions are generally paperback, with small pages designed to be held in the hand and carried, in black and white (or sometimes black, red, and blue) with all images translated to plain text, and designed for ease of publication and distribution in large numbers at an affordable price. They believe the words of Sudocode are what is essential, and the ostentatious format is a priestly dilution of the original intent.)
