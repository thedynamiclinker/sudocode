This note is getting long, but it needs to be.

Without this note, the gift in this box would make no sense.

All that talk about the Sumerian Dog Joke wasn't about Sumer, or Dogs, or Beers, or jokes that may or may not be "somehow about sex."

It was about humans.

How we've been the same since Sumer.

And how hard the Old Things
can be to hear and see,
especially for Modern and
Civilized and Serious Adults
like you and me.

Whenever we approach anything
with a Serious Adult Mind,
whenever we use big fancy words
and frown and furrow the brow
and say "this isn't a joke,"
we're sure to miss the point.

> Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.

That's a good quote. Here's another.

> Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.

The second is from Antoine de Saint-Exupéry in The Little Prince.

The first is from Josh, in Matthew 18:3.

I'm not religious in the usual sense.

But if had my own church,
then in our sermons,
we'd use the name
Josh for the guy
who's usually
called Jesus.

It's a sign of a respect, in our church (we would say) to call him Josh.

When people hear the word "Jesus," they think they know what it means.

Josh is the same name.

But when you say "Josh," people at least squint a bit and listen.

Plus that was his name, so I don't think he would have minded being called that.

> The English name Jesus (Ancient Greek: Ἰησοῦς, romanized Iēsous) is a rendering of Joshua (Hebrew or Aramaic: יֵשׁוּעַ, romanized Yehoshua, later Yeshua), which means "YHWH saves".

The books in this box aren't about Josh.

They're about YHWH, or rather an author called The Yahwist.

They're about how I got so obsessed with these "bible" things, despite not coming to them in the usual way.

The Authors of bibles don't put their names on the cover.

We don't know them by name.

But we know a few things.

"The Yahwist" is the name bible scholars use to refer to the nameless author who wrote of the oldest parts of the Old Testament.

A common view among Christians is that the New Testament God is (to put it mildly) a nicer guy than the Old Testament God.

Many Christians aren't entirely sure what to think about the Old Testament God.

When the unreligious attack religion, they tend to focus on Yahweh.

Believers and unbelievers agree: YHWH is one of the strangest characters in any book.

%%

> And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.

%%

The purpose of this long note (and of this pretty weird gift) is to take a Sumerian Dog Joke approach to the old books.

Or if you prefer, a Matthew 18:3 approach.

When we first heard the Sumerian Dog Joke, we had absolutely no idea what it possibly could have meant, or why anyone would think it was funny.

By the end, we had at least one idea, though we still weren't sure.

When we were kids, everything was like that.

Whatever you believe, it's an incredible experience to take that approach to the bible.

I'm not trying to make any particular point by doing this.

I have no specific "interpretation" or "reading" in mind.

I'm not trying to convince you of anything.

And the exercise works equally well, no matter what you believe.

But I hope you'll follow with me, and at least skim parts of the enclosed books from this perspective.

%%

In a matter of a few hours, I've turned hardened atheists into people who are fascinated by the bible.

They don't end up being religious in the usual sense.

But they all start off seeing the bible how we saw the Sumerian Dog Joke at the beginning: something that maybe made sense once, but doesn't connect at all now.

Afterwards, they end up seeing the bible the way we see the Sumerian Dog Joke now: as the oldest example of _something_ from our species. One they can't claim to understand. But now they're absolutely sure theyre's something there, and they're curious.

Making that change of perspective for an ancient joke doesn't matter much. It's only one-sentence, after all, and it's not part of everyday life.

Making that change of perspective for the bible is considerably more relevant to everyday life.

When I drive Luna to preschool, my close friend Ramya now points out the car window at random churches and shouts "El Shaddai!" and other references, because she recognizes them now.

%%

Imagine you've never heard about the bible.

You've never heard of Adam and Eve, or Moses or the Ten Commandments.

Let's look at this book with fresh eyes and see how truly unusual it is.

---

Four rivers: Tigris, Euphrates, 2 Puns.

Raven and Dove vs Gilgamesh.

Plant of eternal life and snake.

Nostalgic for the old ways.

Enkidu is from Idin, Edin, Eden.

The second day isn't good.

YHWH loses track of Adam.

No record of YHWH before J.

El Shaddai and Exodus 6.

Every sentence starts with "And."

Extremely simple vocabulary.

As different from KJV as possible.

No vowels.

No punctuation.

No chapter numbers.

No verse numbers.

Minimal spacing between words.

Absolutely dripping with puns.

Adam as Guy.

Eve as Vivian.

Moses as Drew.

Rachel and Leah's "Hooray a baby"

First principle of bibles:

- Assume you're missing 80%.

- From Gen 2:11 it starts.

- Rev 1:11 is my favorite example: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea.

- If the heavens ever did speak, what would it sound like?

- Gibberish, Gibberish, Gibberish, Gibberish, America, Gibberish, and Gibberish. ("Hey I know that one!")

## For the unbelievers

YHWH's list of behaviors:

No knowledge of good and bad.

It's not good for the human to be by himself. I'll make a strength corresponding to him. He then makes... animals. "But He did not find for the human a strength corresponding to him." So YHWH messed up twice.

Gen 3:8. YHWH is walking.

Gen 3:9. YHWH loses track of the humans.

Gen 3:11. Who told you that you were naked?

Gen 3:14. YHWH invents domestic violence, labor pain, patriarchy, manual labor, then he curses the ground and tells snakes they don't get to have legs anymore. (Which suggests the one from a few sentences earlier had some.).

Guy names his wife The Living One.

Gen 3:22. And YHWH said, Here, the human has become like one of us, to know good and bad And now, in case he’ll put out his hand and take from the tree of life as well, and eat and live forever.

Gen 4:9. YHWH asks where Cain is.

Gen 4:17. Cain suddenly has a wife.

Gen 4:18. Spreadsheet.

Ancestry is being used here in a pretty unusual way: "And his brother’s name was Yubal He was father of every player of lyre and pipe"

Gen 6: The "Sons of the Gods" or "Sons of God" (בניהאלהים) have sex with human women and give birth to giants.

Gen 6:13. There's too much violence. I'm gonna kill everyone in the world.

Two interwoven flood stories.

Gen 8:20. Immediately after the flood, Noah starts sacrificing the animals he just saved from the flood.

Gen 8:21. YHWH smells the pleasant smell of extinction from Noah's ill-advised animal sacrifices, and YHWH says "I won’t curse the ground on account of humankind again." Why, YHWH? "Because the inclination of the human heart is bad from their youth." In other words "No more floods. Humans are just born shitty."

Ok great, flood's over. Now that we've eliminated all the bad evil stuff and just kept The Most Moral Guy In The World, aka Noah, what righteous moral things shall we do next?

Gen 9:18. Noah gets drunk, passes out, and his dick flops out of his pants.

Oh well. Happens to the best of us. Now what?

Well, Noah's son opens his dad's tent and sees the dick.

Goes and tells his brothers.

The brothers walk backwards holding a sheet so they don't have to see dads dick. Reasonable behavior. No one wants to see that.

The Most Moral Guy In The World, aka Noah, wakes up from his blackout and "saw what his youngest son had done to him" (what?). And he basically disowns the son who saw his dick. Then there's a bunch of puns like "May God enlarge \[guy-whose-name-means-may-he-enlarge\]" (what?!)

Gen 11: YHWH sees that all the humans are cooperating and hanging out and building a big thing, so he goes down and fucks up their shit because cooperation makes them strong and he's scared they might get up to heaven and steal his job. That's the tower of babel story. Keep Calm and Babylon.™

Side Note: Babylon was sort of the America at the time. It's the big empire thing that has lots of diversity and stuff, and occasionally it comes to your home town and does colonialism to you and fucks everything up. That's Babylon around the time J was writing. Actually, about 200 years after J wrote, Babylon came and fucked up Judah (south Jew town), which was where all the Jews lived ever since a hundred or so years earlier when Assyria had come and fucked up Israel (north Jew town), so the empire comparison is pretty on point.

Gen 12: Abraham suddenly shows up. He's from Ur. 

We're still in Mesopotamia here. The Ur and Haran thing happens. Abraham doesn't ask YHWH to help with anything. He doesn't pray to YHWH. He doesn't even really seem to like YHWH. But YHWH shows up and starts following him around and promising him, if you'll pardon my French, an infinite amount of pussy. Which YHWH proceeds to not deliver on like at all. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Let's back up.

Summarize early Abraham.

![[zero/the-beginning/abraham-and-yahweh.png]]

Gen 12:10. Abraham references that song from Rent and says "Hey mister she's my sister" because he's like "Ok wifey you're really hot, they're definitely gonna try to fuck you, and if they think I'm your husband they're probably gonna kill me. So say you're my sister so that I don't get killed and maybe you get fucked but hey safety first."

Gen 12:18-13:2. This entrapment trick turns out to work pretty well and Abraham makes off with loads of apology bling from the embarrassed king who fucked his wife maybe. Don't ask.

Gen 13:4. Abraham goes "Yahweh."

Gen 13:8-ish. This town ain't big enough for the two of us.

As a fan of the ancient books, I'm also a huge fan of Josh.

Love the dude. Think he's fantastic.

Of all the Abrahamic religion, I'd say on net balance Christianity's the best for most people.

For most people.

It works best.

It creates better institutions than Islam or Buddhism.

I would've added Judaism to that list if I weren't so disappointed in my people compared to the Jews, who I think are probably really my people, even though the Christians have a much better God if you're into that sort of thing.

But to me, I can't feel the fire or inspiration at any religion where the ultimate perfect truth is "some specific guy."

Don't get me wrong, I understand perfectly why the above might be appealing to the girl half of our species, by far my favorite half.

But I confess my nativety to the extent that I can't understand what it's like to be a man who says "The solution to every problem is Some Guy."

I'm more impressed by the Christian world, by Christian culture, by Christian institutions and all the rest that I can possibly say.

And for the nonreligious like myself who might feel the lazy retired desire to shout some unthinking reflexive term like "patriarchy" or even "catholic priest molestation scandal" here at this moment, I'd just say whatever culture you belong to has way worse stats on that issue, or whatever issue you hold up as your God.

I find most Christians quite obnoxious. Not you guys. Just most. But they Christians won the battle of who can best make civilization.

Civilization. Whatever that means. Even after every god awful atrocity the old empires committed. "Civilization" in scare quotes. But civilization nonetheless.

So personally, I'm most impressed by the Christians, when it comes to the admiration of those who are best at building a society and a civilization.

But theologically, I couldn't be more disappointed in the Christians.

You could have had it all.

Everyone.

Even the unbelievers.

But you gave up before you got here.

Decided we weren't worth conquering.

We agree.

Because there's a thousand worthwhile gods on this earth.

The only thing that makes a god die is when s/he decides to speak to just some of us humans, and not all of us.

Anyone can kill a god.

All you have to do is politely ask questions, until they reveal they're only for some.

Once you hear that, you're talking to a dead god.

And it's only right, broken son of man, that you step on its dead neck and proceed to the throne.

Peace always.

-Son of J
