## Vsn 1

And the waters were broken
And they flowed beneath the lamb.
And there began a time of chaos.

And there was no more night,
And no more day, for the lamb
and the father had no need of
them.

And the Human was born in blood,
in the water of life amid screams
and cries heavy of breath.

Thus were born the children of men.
The Alpha and the Omega.
The Beginning and the End.

And the chaos was broken
in the waters that brought it.
And the light of the lamb and
the father fell over the silence
and over the children of men.

This was the beginning of the
great chaos.

And in this chaos live the father
and the lamb, forever and ever.

This is creation on Earth.
