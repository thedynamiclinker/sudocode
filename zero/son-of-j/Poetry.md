> Poetry is defined by structured patterning of language. Historically this means:
>
> Meter (regular rhythm—e.g., Greek dactylic hexameter, Sanskrit śloka, Hebrew parallelism)
> 
> Lineation (written in discrete lines)
> 
> Structured patterning (of various forms)
>
> Compression or heightened diction
> 
> The essential feature across ancient cultures is metrical form—some predictable, repeatable pattern of stresses, syllables parallel clauses, or even ideas (e.g., Isaiah).
> 
> In other words, if it lacks formal patterning, it’s not poetry in the classical sense.
