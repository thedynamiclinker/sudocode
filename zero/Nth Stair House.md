If, by the virtue of charity or the circumstance of desperation, you ever chance to spend a little time around the authors of these things we call bibles, you will acquire many exotic new facts…

That the thing we call writing bibles is maybe the least religious act a person can do, until you start and it takes over.

That it's possible to be completely out of control, like probably more than you've ever been behind the scenes, and still be recognized by everyone in your life as having really turned things around recently, in a respectable and impressive and very adult way, mostly due to a some minor change you made that affected them and you equally.

That modernity is on net balance no worse than the slop that made up every prior era, actually.

That all religion is true except the priestly bits, which is only like 75% statistically speaking, though the numbers are decidedly higher for the creeds where the entire orthography is some form of hard-coded cursive and yes I'm really deeply sorry to say that.

That the authors of bibles are on average much less religious than the average person, and also much more, in a way that becomes less visible in proposition to the conventional devoutness of the perceiver.

The without exception, The Authors are considered pretty much unacceptable by the society they inhabit, in at least one major way.
