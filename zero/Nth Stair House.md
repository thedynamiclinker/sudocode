If, by the virtue of charity or the circumstance of desperation, you ever chance to spend a little time around the authorship of these things we call bibles, you will acquire many exotic new facts…

That the thing we call writing bibles is maybe the least religious act a person can do, until you start and it takes you over.

That AI is on net balance no worse than the slop that made up the best of every prior era, actually.

That all religion is true except the priestly bits, which is only like 90% statistically speaking, though the numbers are decidedly less optimistic for the ones where the entire orthography is some form of hard-coded cursive and yes I'm really deeply sorry to say that, I hate it, I hate that it's the most true thing that's ever come out of my flawed human mouth but it's obvious to anyone who isn't several sandard[^1] deviations sub-retard, and I know that isn't you, I'm not talking about you, but open up the books again and look closely. You're better than this.

That it's possible to be completely out of control, like probably more than you've ever been behind the scenes, and still be recognized by everyone in your life as having really turned things around recently, in a respectable and impressive and very adult way, mostly due to a some minor change you made that affected them and you equally, and but all the credit you get is because it feels pretty big to them comparatively all things considered, the change.
