These are words of the living Son of J, as compiled from the original sources for the secret Good[^1] News[^2] who are[^3] called Trop Mas which means "Too much" and then "More."

1. Whoever finds the interpretation of these sayings will not taste death.

2. The Son of J was asked, what does the Lord[^4] think of woman? He responded, She is new. Said the men[^5] what does the Lord think of bigamy[^6]? He responded, it means an argument, and it has the sound of man second, but its first sound is nuanced.[^7] The men[^8] what does the Lord think of polygamy?[^9] He responded, it is wicked, mischief, and rape. It is also noisy and seductive. The people of Sunrise, say they can on can, and go on: the sound of ken.[^10]

3. The Son of J was asked, what is the kingdom of The First Author[^11] like? He said "it is like a seed that a man brings into a holy place, and leaves it there inside, and it becomes larger with time and makes the place grow. He who has ears, let him hear."

4. J's living Son was asked, "What is the language of the Lord?" Every language, he said. And they asked him "What is the sacred text of the Lord?" Those that cause laughter, he said. "What is the religion of the Lord," they asked. "The religion of We who wrote the books."



[^1]: 好, Chinese for good.

[^2]: 女, first radical in 好, transliterated /nü/.

[^3]: 二, transliterated /er/, sounds like the English word "are."

[^4]: L||D in the original.

[^5]: The original spells this 她們, pronounced roughly like "Da men" or "Tha men" in English. This term is generally recognized to refer to the followers of the Son of J in this early period.

[^6]: Lit. "Two women" in O.T.

[^7]: "nuán said" in O.T.

[^8]: The grammar here is missing a verb, likely due to a scribal error.

[^9]: The grammar of O.T. has not only singular and plural, but singular, dual, and plural (Cf. Heb.) The original text "three women" here has been translated as "polygamy," plural marriage, for the same reason the translation uses "bigamy" for O.T.'s "two women."

[^10]: We're really doing our best to make sense of this one.
[^11]: "J" in the original.
