## Names

1: Wait, doesn't basically every group call themselves "The Foundational People"?

0: I don't think so. What do you mean?

1: I don't want to derail the book. I'll explain in [[names|/opt/names]].

## Numbers

0: Wow, I learned something new today. Anyways, where were we?

1: You said we're...

0: The Foundational People. Exactly.

1: So I said "Wait, doesn't basically every group call themselves The Foundational People"?

0: Well apparently so. But I didn't mean it like that.

1: Like what?

0: I didn't mean we're "The Foundational People" as in "The best people." I meant our people trace our ancestry back to, well, the Foundations.

1: I'm gonna need an explanation of why this is different from the tribe thing.

0: I don't want to derail the book. I'll explain in [[numbers|/opt/numbers]].

## Genesis

1: Ow. I think I pulled a muscle that time. You need to warn me before these pops.

0: There wasn't time. Last we left off, mathematics was sinking. Something had to be done, and quick.

1: What's the problem? These infinite numbers don't seem like that big of a deal. I mean sure they're weird, but how is this a threat to calculus or geometry?

0: Because of what happened next.

1: What happened next?

0: The beginning.

1: The beginning of what?

0: Of the story of our people.

1: WE HAVEN'T EVEN GOT TO THE BEGINNING YET?!

0: Not quite. Head over to this file with me.

1: I can't believe we're not even---

0: Stop whining and get in. Things are about to get good.

# Todo

To finish this file, we need to find ways to include 2 more top level section headings in this file, called:

## And he called
This is secretly Leviticus. Make it a joke about stack frames and how we keep using goto. From here on, change goto to call.

## The second law
Deuteronomy, but we'll talk about information entropy to connect it to the second law of thermodynamics.

These are secretly the names (either in English or translated from Hebrew) of the five books of the Torah. Exodus in Hebrew is called the book of Names. And Numbers is book four.
