A small collection of examples.

Background:
- The [build](https://github.com/pypa/build) library is the _reference implementation_ of a python build frontend by the [Python Packaging Authority](https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/) (the people who maintain `pip`, `setuptools`, `virtualenv`, etc.). Because it's a reference implementation, the project's readme has no shame in declaring itself "correct." If you want to make some code you wrote `pip install`-able, `build` is the simplest way to do so. We use it for that purpose in all our python projects. Despite describing itself as "correct," its master branch is often broken, in the sense of failing some test or another. These two things are not in conflict.
