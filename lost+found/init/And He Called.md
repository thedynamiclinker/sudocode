Draw a picture of the family tree implied here:

> Alonzo Church was born on June 14, 1903, in Washington, D.C., where his father, Samuel Robbins Church, was a justice of the peace[5] and the judge of the Municipal Court for the District of Columbia. He was the grandson of Alonzo Webster Church (1829–1909), United States Senate Librarian from 1881 to 1901, and great-grandson of Alonzo Church, a professor of Mathematics and Astronomy and 6th President of the University of Georgia.[6] As a young boy, Church was partially blinded by an air gun accident.[7] The family later moved to Virginia after his father lost his position at the university because of failing eyesight. With help from his uncle, also named Alonzo Church, the son attended the private Ridgefield School for Boys in Ridgefield, Connecticut.[8] After graduating from Ridgefield in 1920, Church attended Princeton University, where he was an exceptional student. He published his first paper on Lorentz transformations[9] in 1924 and graduated the same year with a degree in mathematics. He stayed at Princeton for graduate work, earning a Ph.D. in mathematics in three years under Oswald Veblen. He married Mary Julia Kuczinski in 1925. The couple had three children: Alonzo Jr. (1929), Mary Ann (1933), and Mildred (1938).

Include the bit about how everyone in his family was called Alonzo Church.

Talk about lambda calculus.

Everything is functions. Even Booleans and Natural Numbers.

"And he called" comes up again as the essentially infinite call stacks that results.

Church received an honorary Doctor of Science degrees from Case Western Reserve University in 1969!

We'll be going there later to meet Chet.
