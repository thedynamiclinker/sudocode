## A bit suspicious

1: Wait I thought we were gonna be talking about Turing.

0: We are!

1: Why is this file called "The Second Law"?

0: Y'know...

- The Second Law
- Entropy
- Information
- Bits
- 0 & 1
- Turing machines!

1: What?

_(Narrator: 1 was not convinced.)_

0: Turing's 1936 paper was the first time we see the idea of a machine that operates on binary numbers.

1: Can you explain that... I dunno... better?

0: Sure!

- The Second Law (of thermodynamics is all about)
- Entropy (which has the same mathematical form as)
- Information (in Claude Shannon's information theory which is measured in)
- Bits (namely)
- 0 & 1 (which are the symbols used in the original paper about)
- Turing machines!

1: That's a pretty tenuous chain of reasoning.

0: C'mon, that's a big moment for us!

1: _(Re-reading the bullets up above)_

0: _(Trying to sound convincing)_ After all, we are 0 &---

1: Is this a bible thing somehow?

## Dude they're onto me

0: What on earth would make you thi---

1: Zero?

0: What?

_(Narrator: 0 appeared to be hiding something.)_

1: ...

0: Ok...

1: Have all these files been a bible reference?

0: _(Looking down and to the left)_ ... Maybe.

1: Damn how much effort did you put into sneaking that past me?

0: Not much.

1: Get to the Turing bit.

## The Enigma

> Steve Kleene: Well as I say, I don't know how firmly convinced Gödel was that his General Recursive Functions represented all effectively calculable functions.
>
> Gerald Sacks: He seemed very skeptical.
>
> Steve Kleene: I think he was skeptical. And it may well be that Turing's presentation was what brought Gödel around.

0: So Church comes up with Lambda Calculus. Gödel comes up with General Recursive Functions. Kleene proves the two systems are equivalent. And legend has it that when Gödel realized his system was equivalent to Church's Gödel says "Oh. Well then I guess mine was wrong."

1: Did that actually happen?

0: Not sure, but it's a good legend.

1: So how does Turing fit in to this?

0: Well Turing's work is what convinced Gödel.

1: Convinced him of what?

0: That the three of them had probably captured _all_ of computation in these definitions. 

1: Damn, what year was this?

0: 1936.

1: That's insane.

> Steve Kleene: We had done all this work before we heard of Turing. Turing's paper is also 1936. But a little later in 1936. But my impression is that Turing did it independently of knowing anything about what we were doing.

0: Yeah so Turing is over in England. Born in 1912 in the Paddington part of London where that famous bear is from. By this point he's 24 years old. Still an undergraduate. He's not aware of any of this work from Church, he may have known about Gödel. And he comes out with this paper as a 24 year old college kid that ends up convincing Gödel.

TODO: Give more personal background in this file. Then in the twin file in `fini`, we'll explain Turing machines and how they work.
