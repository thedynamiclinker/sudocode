## (2,2): The Names of /dev/zero

1: Zero

0: _(Unintelligible)_

1: ZERO!

0: _(Startled)_ AH!

1: Sorry.

0: _(Sleepy)_ What's up?

1: I found you in the `/mnt` directory.

0: Why was...

1: I think you fell asleep. You've been working too hard.

0: _(Muffled groan)_

1: Here... I found you with this.

_(Narrator: 1 hands 0 the following image.)_

![[trinity-8-unhinged-explained.png|300]]

1: No idea what it's all about but it's pretty scary.

0: _(Suddenly energetic)_ Wonderful!

1: Am I supposed to get something out of this?

0: No no, I don't expect it to make sense. I fell asleep halfway through.

1: Should I be worried?

0: Absolutely not!

1: Are you sure?

0: Totally. I know it took us a while to get here, but I finally figured it out.

1: Figured what out?

0: Where to start.

1: Where to start _what?_

0: The creation story.

1: Zero, look. I know you need to get this history stuff out of your system for some reason before we get to computing---

0: This is computing.

1: Fine, but if we need to do some history before we get to the more, you know, "actual computing" parts of computing, the technical stuff, can we _please_ just learn the _actual_ history instead of doing more of this creation story or bible stuff or whatever you're doing here?

0: _(Immediately)_ Ok.

1: Wow I didn't think you'd actually agr---

## AL

0: _(Calm and understanding)_ Let's assume we did that. Where would you propose we start?

1: Haven't we already _started_? I mean this has been going a while.

0: Cantor, Russell, and Hilbert were just set up. The creation story proper was just about to begin, as I was trying to explain with that diagram above.

1: The schizo one?

0: If that's what you think it was, then yes. So forget that for now, and forget the bits about Cantor and Russell and Hilbert. Suppose you're writing a history of this field.

1: What field?

0: What's an ALU?

1: Why do you always do this?

0: Answer me seriously. What's an ALU?

1: It's like the part of a CPU where the magic happens.

0: You can be more precise than that.

1: Ok so I'm not a hardware expert or whatever, and I know real hardware is, well, hard. As in more complicated than what I'm about to say. But the basic idea as far as I think of it is:

$$CPU = ALU + MEMORY$$ 0: Memory in what sense?

1: Not like RAM. I mean registers. Or, actually, here let me rewrite that.

$$CPU = BooleanLogic + SequentialLogic$$
0: What's sequential logic?

1: It's a way of doing logic stuff that incorporates time. Boolean gates like AND and OR don't really "store" anything. They just pass bits through and change them. Sequential logic is sort of like the basic "logic gates" you need in order to build stuff that stores data over time.

0: That was a surprisingly good answer. You left something out of the first terms in the second equation though.

1: How?

0: Well if I understand your analogy correctly, you're saying:

$$ALU = BooleanLogic$$
1: Oh hah oops, yeah that's wrong. I should have written this.

$$ALU = BooleanLogic + Arithmetic$$

0: Why's that?

1: I mean it's in the name. "Arithmetic Logic Unit." So obviously:

$$Arithmetic \; Logic \; Unit = Arithmetic + Logic$$
0: Great! I didn't expect your answer to be that good.

1: Have a little faith in me.

0: Likewise. Anyways back to your idea.

1: Which idea?

0: Of doing without this whole "creation story" thing and instead just writing a proper history of the field you just described.

1: I didn't describe a field.

0: Sure you did!

1: Where?

0: Well that's the field we need to write a history of.

$$Computation = Arithmetic + Logic$$

0: You can add "memory" in there too if you want, but in the early days of our field, the "memory" was just brains and paper so that part didn't get formalized until 1936.

1: What field is this?

0: Ours! Foundations. Computing. Foundations and history of computing. Which by definition is the same as---

1: Arithmetic + Logic?

0: Exactly!

1: What kind of field is that?

## Super Advanced Kindergarten

1: Why are we in a section called "super advanced kindergarten"?

0: Why ALUs?

1: What?

0: Why don't we have geometry or algebra or topology processing units?

1: Isn't a GPU sort of a geometry processing unit?

0: Very good point! But in principle, when it comes to what's required for computation, super advanced kindergarten turned out to be all we need.

1: Super advanced kindergarten is...?

0: Arithmetic plus logic. Add those two things and you have an ALU. Add some memory and you have a CPU. And with a CPU, the logic of every other discipline can be emulated. That's why we don't have "Differentiable manifold processing units" or "Hilbert space processing units" or any of---

1: I don't know what those are, but---

0: You don't need to. That's the point. You said it yourself. Computation is more than just logic. It's logic plus arithmetic.

1: So?

0: Well that's kindergarten. "Arithmetic" is just "plus" and "times." And maybe some limited versions of minus and divide, but they're less important in kindergarten. We're just natural numbers here: $0, \; 1, \; \dots$ and so on. No negativity allowed in super advanced kindergarten.

1: Why are you talking about this?

0: Because that's the field we need to write a history of. You said you wanted to stop this "bible" stuff and do a proper history instead of a creation story. So let's do that.

1: How do we do that?

0: Well I've narrowed the scope of the problem by defining our field.

1: Which is---

0: Super advanced kindergarten. Arithmetic plus logic.

1: Look I'm not super interested in the history of arithmetic, that sounds super boring. If we have to go back to pre-historic rock counting or whatever I'm gonna die of boredom.

0: Valid point. That's the problem with writing a history of any idea. You can usually find the seeds of any big idea in writers almost arbitrarily far back in history. The end result of which (if taken seriously) is that you better learn hieroglyphs because you're gonna end up attributing basically everything to ancient Egypt.

1: Can we not do that?

0: Of course. Where do you propose we start the complete history you suggested?

1: Well if we skip arithmetic, the history of logic doesn't sound so bad.

0: And where do you propose we start that?

1: ... At the beginning?

0: The very beginning?

1: The very beginning.

0: If you insist...
