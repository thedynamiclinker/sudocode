0: Once upon a time, there was a guy named Sam.

1: Ooh I love story time.

0: Sam had an unusual family tree.

As a child, during that earliest stage of life when we're looking around the world for the first time and learning what things are called, Sam learned the following:

1. Your Name: Sam
2. Your Father: Alonzo Church
3. Your Brother: Alonzo Church
4. Your Grandfather: Alonzo Church

1: That's a lot of Alonzo Church.

0: For real. And Sam wasn't Alonzo Church. He was the only one who wasn't.

1: Must be rough to get excluded from being Alonzo Church when everyone you know gets to be that.

0: Exactly. So when it came time for Sam to have a son, he pulled a fast one on his brother -- the first born -- and added an item of his own to own the family's family tree. So now, thanks to Sam, the family tree looked like this.

1. Your Name: Sam
2. Your Father: Alonzo Church
3. Your Brother: Alonzo Church
4. Your Grandfather: Alonzo Church
5. Your Son: Alonzo Church

1: Damn Sam. That's cold.

0: "Take that, Alonzo Church," I imagine him saying to his brother Alonzo Church, when he named his son Alonzo Church.

1: Did he actually say that?

0: No idea. But eventually Sam's son would have a son of his own. And he called---

1: I wonder what he's gonna call it.

0: Drumroll.

1. Your Name: Sam
2. Your Father: Alonzo Church
3. Your Brother: Alonzo Church
4. Your Grandfather: Alonzo Church
5. Your Son: Alonzo Church
6. Your Grandson: Alonzo Church

1: Why are we talking about this?

0: Because trinities are known to be full of mysteries. And Alonzo Church is the first member of our trinity.

1: All five Alonzo Churches are members of the trinity?

0: No. Just one.

1: Which one?

0: Sam's son. The one who wasn't supposed to be Alonzo Church.

1: I'm glad it was that one. He seemed like the underdog.

0: Alonzo Church would go on to do a lot of things, but he's most well known for one thing.

1: What one thing?

0: For inventing the first programming language.

1: Woah seriously?

0: Before computers. Before the field even had an agreed upon definition of "computation."

1: What did it run on?

0: Paper.

1: Woah.

0: It was a strange programming language with only one type.

1: Only one type?

0: Only one type. In terms of built-in types, the language has no numbers.

1: No numbers?!

0: No booleans.

1: No booleans?!?!

0: No `if` or `for` or `while`.

1: This language sounds insane.

0: There's only one built-in type.

1: Is it Alonzo Church?

0: Nope. But Alonzo Church had a lot of experience with systems where everything is one type.

1: Like his family?

0: Yep. So when he grew up and went into the foundations of mathematics, and even more deep into the foundations of logic itself, he came up with a system where everything is functions.

1: Numbers are functions?!

0: Numbers are functions.

1: Booleans are functions?!?!

0: Booleans are functions.

1: Such an Alonzo Church thing to do.

0: It's not as crazy as it sounds. It's actually an incredibly powerful idea. He just didn't realize that at the time.

1: HE didn't realize that?

0: Nope. No one did.

1: Can I have some more details?

0: Of course. Let's go take a tour.

1: Woah you weren't just making that up?

0: Of course not. I would never lie to you.

1: Hey there's another one!

0: Told ya. They're all over the place.

![[church-02.png]]

1: Damn look at that handsome guy.

0: For real. Could have gone into Hollywood.

1: Why didn't he?

0: Well he's a foundational person. So naturally, he went into foundations.

![[church-04.png]]

0: Did his dissertation on the Axiom of choice.

1: What's that?

0: Well remember, by this time, it's been about 50 years since Cantor, and almost 30 years since 1900 when Hilbert announced his list of problems. So there's been a reasonable amount of work on the foundations of mathematics since then.

1: Why aren't we including those people in "The foundational people"?

0: Good point. Some of them probably deserve to be included too. But every story has to start somewhere, and for a bible on the history of computing, Church is a pretty good place to start.

1: What was going on in the 30 years before this?

0: Well there had been some work on axiomatic set theory. Mostly on a system called ZFC, or Zermelo Fraenkel (with the Axiom of) Choice. That system is still considered the "official" foundations of mathematics by mathematicians today, but it's never really been _used_ as foundations in any real sense.

1: What do you mean "used as foundations."

0: I mean nobody uses it.

1: What?!

0: Or almost nobody. They usually just talk about it or assert that ZFC proves such-and-such. It's extremely rare to see mathematicians actually working _within_ ZFC as a formal system.

1: That doesn't seem so bad. I mean we programmers don't really write in machine code, like ever. But it's sort of the "foundations" of any language that compiles to it, in a sense.

0: No no, I mean even books about ZFC don't work within ZFC.

1: WHAT?!

0: Here I'll show you.
