0: Ok this is from Church's 1935 paper "An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory." This came out about 7 months before Turing's famous paper that showed the same thing. 

1: No way!

0: Turing's paper broke new ground in different ways, but Church got there first.

1: Never heard that before.

0: And if we read this paper, it's pretty clear that "Church" getting there first is like 80-90% Kleene.

1: Kleene's not even a co-author though.

0: Not sure why. Church generally seemed like a generous dude. But just drag your eyes lazily over the pictures below this. This is all from the same paper.

1: Damn that's a lot of Kleene.

0: Church is like "Our integers are different.

![[church-says-kleene-kleene-kleene-14.png]]

0: But this proof is Kleene.

1: Why is he citing him so much?

0: Kleene implemented everything.

1: Definite first programmer vibes.

1: This is an impressive git blame.

0: Seriously. Church is acting more like a faithful `git blame` implementation than a normal human writing an academic paper.

1: The more I learn about these logic folks the more I like them.

0: How so?

1: I dunno. They're nerds. It feels familiar.

![[church-says-kleene-kleene-kleene-21.png]]

1: Church is like "I'm still here guys, I'm gonna say Kleene some more."

1: Good lord man.

![[church-says-kleene-kleene-kleene-23.png]]

1: It keeps going.

1: This is getting ridiculous.

![[church-says-kleene-kleene-kleene-26.png]]


1: I don't even know what he's talking about but this makes me want to read Kleene.

0: We will. That's why I'm showing you this.

1: Why?

0: So you don't get sad when we get to the frighteningly technical book.

1: Uh oh. Is it bad?

0: Nah it's easy. You'll enjoy it.

1: I've got to say, I thought you exaggerating but that was intense.

0: That's from _one_ paper.

1: Damn, Church.

0: Ok but I was unfair to Church earlier. When Kleene said "I have to give the credit to Church, I can't take it myself," he wasn't talking about all the programming, he was talking about Church's thesis.

1: What's Church's thesis.

0: "That's everything."

1: What's everything?

0: Church's thesis is "Hey Kleene, I think maybe we got everything?"

1: _What's everything?_

0: All the computable functions. Or effectively calculable as they called them back then.

1: That's Church's thesis. "We're done."

0: That's it.

1: Why "thesis" and not "theorem"?

0: Because it's saying "I think this informal concept equals this formal concept." Can't exactly prove that in the usual mathematical sense. It's pre-mathematics. The hypothesis is that lambda definability captures what we intuitively mean by "computable." Way more powerful than just a theorem.

1: What on earth made him thing "We got ALL computation"?

0: Kleene.

1: Kleene?

0: I mean Kleene's programming. Church was convinced before Kleene was. Then Kleene tried to disprove Church, failed, and got converted.

> Someone: Was Church's thesis just an offhand remark?

> Steve Kleene: Well he spent some months sweating over it. And saying "Don't you think it's so?" And I was a skeptic! When he came out and asserted the thesis I said "He can't be right." So I went home and I thought I would diagonalize myself out. Out of the class of the lambda definable functions and get another effectively calculable function that wasn't lambda definable. Well just in one night I realized you couldn't do that, and from that point on I was a convert.
