## Everybody Hates Code

Have you ever had some open source project that you loved using, and wanted to dig into the internals and see how it worked by reading the code?

Did you actually download it and read through the code?

What happened?

If you're human, I can probably guess the answer.

Disgust.

Absolute. Overwhelming. Unequivocal. Disgust.

> Why the hell is there so much code? Where the fuck are the interesting bits? Is ALL of this shit important? Jesus Christ who are these people?

After awhile, maybe the disgust turned inward.

> Maybe I'm the problem. After all, I'm a "developer." Why does this code feel so completely beyond me?

We like it when code is open, but we fucking hate reading it.

Especially when there's a lot of it, which is always.

This is the paradox of Open Source.

The thing we call "Open Source" in our field is so absolutely fundamental that software development can barely exist in any meaningful sense without it.

But that thing we call Open Source is absolutely NOT about "Openness" or "Source Code."

So what is it?
