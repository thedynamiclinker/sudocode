# Hello World! © ® ™

This is the true story of The Hello Corporation,
an organization where all the software is Hello World.

Many other Enterprises in the software space think
we have it easy over here at The Hello Corporation,
because all our software is trivial.

Nothing could be further from the truth. We find that
software development at The Hello Corporation is just
as complex and difficult as at other enterprises.

This is not a joke. We're not making things complex
on purpose to make fun of over-engineered software,
like the classic "Fizzbuzz Enterprise Edition" repo.

Nor are we a bunch of slackers who just get high all
the time, despite the fact that our name is THC©®™.

We founded The Hello Corporation to help your company.

If you work in technology, whether as a developer or
a manager or an executive, there are probably a lot of
things you and your team do that you believe are
"best practices." Many of them probably are. But how
would you know if some of those practices had been
implemented in subtly incorrect ways that made them
useless, or even actively harmful? How would you know
if some simple requirement you'd imposed on your team
in the hope of a 5-10% benefit on some metric or other
was was causing every project you worked on to take
twice as long?

How is a manager or executive at a technology company
supposed to understand which of the many things their
business does are imposing excessive costs for zero
benefit?

We founded The Hello Corporation to help your company
answer those questions, by offering a standard environment
in which any organization can carry out a complexity audit.

An "audit" is an official inspection of some aspect of
an individual or organization by an independent body.

An audit is something you do when you want an outside
expert's opinion on whether you're screwing something up.

Every field has its own form of audit.

- For security, we have static analysis and pentesting.
- For finances, we have accountants, and, well, audits.
- For complexity, we have nothing.

Complexity is the ultimate enemy in software development.
- Not bugs.
- Not vulnerabilities.
- Not slow execution.

The eternal enemy your dev team faces every hour of
every day at work is complexity.

Looking around at most tech companies and dev teams,
it's hard not to conclude that complexity won.

Who do you call when you need to simplify things?
When you're having trouble onboarding new employees
because everything is chaotic, even after all those
efforts you made to document this or standardize that?

We believe a standardized concept of complexity auditing
is an essential service that every technology company
could benefit from, but which is entirely absent from
the industry at present.

That what we do, here at The Hello Corporation.

We help technology companies audit every aspect
of their stack, including:

- onboarding
- development
  - within project
    - documentation
    - testing
    - version control
    - dev environments
    - ci/cd pipelines
  - between project
    - code-reuse
    - packaging
    - dependency management
    - vcs collaboration models
- security
  - authentication (iam, sso)
  - vulnerability management

and anything else that the developers on your team come
into contact with on a daily basis.

How can we audit all those things?

By asking how your team's processes for handling each item
above would scale if all the complexity of your real
software was removed.

Because as we say here at The Hello Corporation:

> If your current processes make it difficult to scale hello world,
> you may want to rethink your business model.
