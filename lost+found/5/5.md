0: ... and remember back in Church when we said this?

> 0: ZFC blah blah sets. PA blah blah numbers. It's not unreasonable to think something like "Look guys, those theories you made are cute and all, but the foundations of mathematics or even reasoning itself blah blah blah should be something more primitive."
> 
> 1: What's more primitive than blah blah?
> 
> 0: Well there are infinitely many blah blah. And that's not a blah blah in itself, but we'd like our foundations to be something inherently finite.
> 
> 1: Inherently finite?
> 
> 0: Inherently finite. I mean when a mathematician proves stuff about the natural numbers by induction, they do it with only a finite amount of time and food and paper and pencils and erasers and pants and money and blah blah. Finite everything.
> 
> 1: Blobviously. What's your point?

> Something that's hiding in plain sight all around us if we could just open our eyes and see what X is.
> 
> Something that's painted all over every sentence in every area of mathematics, both the discrete areas like number theory and combinatorics and graph theory, and the continuous areas like calculus and geometry and topology.
> 
> Our X should be staring us in the face whenever we open any textbook, and when first hear someone say what it is we should feel a feeling of "Damn. Of course. Why didn't I think of that?"

> 0: You tell me.

1: Why'd you stop there?

0: Because of what comes next.

1: I'm pretty sure I said functions.

0: Church said functions. And you said functions in Church.

1: Where are we now?

0: Turing. This is Turing.

1: So the answer is "machines"?

0: No.

1: I'm pretty sure it's "machines."

> _We may now construct a machine to do the work of this computer._

1: Woah what was that?

0: What was what?

1: The quote that just went by. It seemed like it knew something I didn't.

0: Sorry I was writing. What's the question?

1: What's more primitive than blah blah?

0: Is blah blah "functions" or "machines" there?

1: Same thing.

0: What's the question?

1: What's more primitive than functions?

0: The answer's staring us in the face.

_(Narrator: 1 looks back at the blah blah quote.)_

1: _(Reading carefully)_

> ...when a mathematician proves stuff about the natural numbers by induction, they do it with only a finite amount of time and food and paper...

1: Can I have a hint?

0: Here's one:

>  and pencils and erasers and...

1: I mean a new hint.

0: Ok, here:

> Our X should be staring us in the face whenever we open any textbook...

1: ZERO!

0: Ok here, one more:

> and when first hear someone say what it is we should feel a feeling of "Damn. Of course. Why didn't I think of that?"

> 1: Seems reasonable. What kind of thing is like that?

1: ...

0: What's the only thing you see when you look at any page of any mathematics textbook ever written?

1: Math?

0: Simpler.

1: I don't know.

## How to become Universal
We basically just need if and gotos[^2] to get universality. Plus the ability to write whatever we want, of course.

## On Turing's eccentricities at Bletchley Park

> _In the first week of June each year \[Turing\] would get a bad attack of hay fever, and he would cycle to the office wearing a service gas mask to screen the pollen. His bicycle had a fault: the chain would come off at regular intervals. Instead of having it mended he would count the number of times the pedals went round and would get off the bicycle in time to adjust the chain by hand._
> -Charles Petzold, The Annotated Turing

## On Turing and Joan Clarke, 1941

> _In the spring of 1941, Alan Turing made a proposal of marriage to Joan Clarke, one of the rare women at Bletchley Park who wasn’t relegated to a mindless clerical job. Joan Clarke had been studying mathematics at Cambridge when she was recruited for code-breaking. A few days after the proposal Turing confessed to her that he had "homosexual tendencies" but the engagement continued for several more months before he felt he had to call it off._
> -Charles Petzold, The Annotated Turing

## On Turing's 1942-43 mission and meetings at Bell Labs

> _In November 1942, Turing was sent on a mission to Washington, D.C., to help coordinate code-breaking activities between England and the United States. Following that assignment, he spent the first two months of 1943 at Bell Laboratories, at the time located on West Street in New York City. There he met Harry Nyquist (1889-1976), who pioneered the theory of digital sampling, and Claude Elwood Shannon (1916-2001), whose paper "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" (1948) would found the field of information theory and introduce the word "bit" to the world._
> -Charles Petzold, The Annotated Turing

## Other Quotes

> _Let us now return to the analogy of the theoretical computing machines... It can be shown that a single special machine of that type can be made to do the work of all. It could in fact be made to work as a model of any other machine. The special machine may be called the universal machine..._
> -Alan Turing, Lecture to the London Mathematieal Society, February 20th 1947

> _If it should turn out that the basic logics of a machine designed for the numerical solution of differential equations coincide with the logics of a machine intended to make bills for a department store, I would regard this as the most amazing coincidence I have ever encountered._  
> -Howard Aiken 1956
