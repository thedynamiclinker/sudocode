0: ... and remember back in Church when we said this?

> 0: Well there are infinitely many blah blah. And that's not a blah blah in itself, but we'd like our foundations to be something inherently finite.

1: Why'd you stop there?

0: Because of what comes next.

1: I'm pretty sure I said functions.

0: Church said functions. And you said functions in Church.

1: Where are we now?

0: Turing. This is Turing.

1: So the answer is "machines"?

0: No.

1: I'm pretty sure it's "machines."

1: Woah what was that?

0: What was what?

1: The quote that just went by. It seemed like it knew something I didn't.

0: Sorry I was writing. What's the question?

1: What's more primitive than blah blah?

0: Is blah blah "functions" or "machines" there?

1: Same thing.

0: What's the question?

1: What's more primitive than functions?

0: The answer's staring us in the face.

_(Narrator: 1 looks back at the blah blah quote.)_

1: _(Reading carefully)_

> ...when a mathematician proves stuff about the natural numbers by induction, they do it with only a finite amount of time and food and paper...

1: Can I have a hint?

0: Here's one:

>  and pencils and erasers and...

1: I mean a new hint.

0: Ok, here:

> Our X should be staring us in the face whenever we open any textbook...

1: ZERO!

0: Ok here, one more:

1: ...

0: What's the only thing you see when you look at any page of any mathematics textbook ever written?

1: Math?

0: Simpler.

1: I don't know.

## How to become Universal

We basically just need if and gotos[^2] to get universality. Plus the ability to write whatever we want, of course.

## On Turing's eccentricities at Bletchley Park

> _In the first week of June each year \[Turing\] would get a bad attack of hay fever, and he would cycle to the office wearing a service gas mask to screen the pollen. His bicycle had a fault: the chain would come off at regular intervals. Instead of having it mended he would count the number of times the pedals went round and would get off the bicycle in time to adjust the chain by hand._
> -Charles Petzold, The Annotated Turing

## On Turing and Joan Clarke, 1941

> _In the spring of 1941, Alan Turing made a proposal of marriage to Joan Clarke, one of the rare women at Bletchley Park who wasn’t relegated to a mindless clerical job. Joan Clarke had been studying mathematics at Cambridge when she was recruited for code-breaking. A few days after the proposal Turing confessed to her that he had "homosexual tendencies" but the engagement continued for several more months before he felt he had to call it off._
> -Charles Petzold, The Annotated Turing

## On Turing's 1942-43 mission and meetings at Bell Labs

> _In November 1942, Turing was sent on a mission to Washington, D.C., to help coordinate code-breaking activities between England and the United States. Following that assignment, he spent the first two months of 1943 at Bell Laboratories, at the time located on West Street in New York City. There he met Harry Nyquist (1889-1976), who pioneered the theory of digital sampling, and Claude Elwood Shannon (1916-2001), whose paper "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" (1948) would found the field of information theory and introduce the word "bit" to the world._
> -Charles Petzold, The Annotated Turing

## Other Quotes

> _Let us now return to the analogy of the theoretical computing machines... It can be shown that a single special machine of that type can be made to do the work of all. It could in fact be made to work as a model of any other machine. The special machine may be called the universal machine..._
> -Alan Turing, Lecture to the London Mathematieal Society, February 20th 1947

> _If it should turn out that the basic logics of a machine designed for the numerical solution of differential equations coincide with the logics of a machine intended to make bills for a department store, I would regard this as the most amazing coincidence I have ever encountered._  
> -Howard Aiken 1956

0: Turing finished the proof of the three-way equivalence, thus establishing more clearly than anyone else the plausibility of Church's Thesis, now called Church-Turing. This was the final nail in the coffin. These three giants, the first three developers in the history of computing who together made the first language, the first compiler, and the first hardware design, these same these people now also seemed to have captured the concept of computation itself, in three definitions that none of them expected to be the same. Except maybe Turing. They captured the essence of computation, not within some particular formal system or machine, but any computation that could ever be performed by any physical system past or future. They got it. The final nail was this 1937 paper down below. Almost 100 years later, after all the developments in computing and technology since the late 1930s, our species still hasn;t found a single counterexample to Church and Turing's claim. Computation has a ceiling. That ceiling is universal. And it's damn easy to get there. Everything else is lots and lots of details that take place at or below the ceiling. I can't think of a more important achievement in the foundations of human knowledge in all of human history than that. The story of computation and how our species captured it is as important as the discovery of fire. I think even the discovery of electricity or magnetism or the strong and weak nuclear forces aren't as incredible as the discovery of computation. Despite all the well-deserved books about Gödel and Turing, this story is never told with anything close to the energy it deserves. And I can feel in my bones every way that the version of it I've told here is still an absolute failure compared to what this story deserves. It would take a new curriculum to really tell it properly. Students in our field, and even the profess{or, ional developer}s of our field don't know enough about the beginning or the middle of this story. Sadly most of us know about the end.

1: What was the end?

0: Not the end of the story. But an end to this thread.

![[turing-1937-sex-footnote-1.png]]

0: In any sane universe, Turing's sex life would've been no more than a footnote to his story. No more significant than a randomly chosen footnote in one of his papers.

![[turing-1937-sex-footnote-2.png]]

1: What's that?

0: A footnote in one of his papers that happens to say $S(e(x))$.

1: Is this supposed to be important?

0: No. That's the point. In Turing's story, what should have been an unimportant footnote that happened to say $S(e(x))$ turned out to lead to the premature end of his story.

1: THAT footnote led to---

0: No not that one. I don't think anyone even noticed that one. Not sure Turing noticed either, though I like to think he did. This next bit is the sad one. The one people noticed.

![[yours-in-distress-alan.png]]

1: What does it say? I can't quite read it.

0: Something like this.[^3]

> My dear Norman,

> I don’t think I really do know much about jobs, except the one I had during the war, and that certainly did not involve any travelling. I think they do take on conscripts. It certainly involved a good deal of hard thinking, but whether you’d be interested I don’t know. Philip Hall was in the same racket and on the whole, I should say, he didn’t care for it. However I am not at present in a state in which I am able to concentrate well, for reasons explained in the next paragraph.

> I’ve now got myself into the kind of trouble that I have always considered to be quite a possibility for me, though I have usually rated it at about 10:1 against. I shall shortly be pleading guilty to a charge of sexual offences with a young man. The story of how it all came to be found out is a long and fascinating one, which I shall have to make into a short story one day, but haven’t the time to tell you now. No doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man, but quite who I’ve not found out.
