## A bit suspicious

1: Wait I thought we were gonna be talking about Turing.

0: We are!

1: Why is this file called "The Second Law"?

0: Y'know...

- The Second Law
- Entropy
- Information
- Bits
- 0 & 1
- Turing machines!

1: What?

_(Narrator: 1 was not convinced.)_

0: Turing's 1936 paper was the first time we see the idea of a machine that operates on binary numbers.

1: Can you explain that... I dunno... better?

0: Sure!

- The Second Law (of thermodynamics is all about)
- Entropy (which has the same mathematical form as)
- Information (in Claude Shannon's information theory which is measured in)
- Bits (namely)
- 0 & 1 (which are the symbols used in the original paper about)
- Turing machines!

1: That's a pretty tenuous chain of reasoning.

0: C'mon, that's a big moment for us!

1: _(Re-reading the bullets up above)_

0: _(Trying to sound convincing)_ After all, we are 0 &---

1: Is this a bible thing somehow?

## Dude they're onto me

0: What on earth would make you thi---

1: Zero?

0: What?

_(Narrator: 0 appeared to be hiding something.)_

1: ...

0: Ok...

1: Have all these files been a bible reference?

0: _(Looking down and to the left)_ ... Maybe.

1: Damn how much effort did you put into sneaking that past me?

0: Not much.
