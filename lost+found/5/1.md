## 1: Marks

<span style="font-size: 64pt">T</span>he beginning of the story of A.M.T.[^1] the Martyr.
  <span style="font-size: 32pt">A</span>s it was written in the book T.M.A.[^2] by Leibniz,

In the eighty sixth year of the seventeenth century of the old calendar,[^3]

> _It is unworthy of excellent men_
>
> _to lose hours like slaves_
>
> _in the labour of calculation_
>
> _which could safely be relegated_
>
> _to anyone if machines were used._

And Leibniz spoke of a Logos[^4] that would come after him,

That would be a universal way of writing,

Able to express within it

All Things that are, for out of Writing[^5]

All that was ever Written was made.

> _… \[A\]ʟᴀɴguage or universal writing,_
> 
> _infinitely different from all hitherto projected,_
> 
> _because the very characters[^6]_
> 
> _would guide the reason;_
> 
> _and errors, except those of fact,_
> 
> _would be only errors of computation._

And in the fifteenth year of the eighteenth century of the old calendar,

Leibniz, who was also called God's peace,[^7]

lamented against the scholars, saying

> _I have spoken of my \[Logos\] to others,_
> 
> _but they have given it no more attention_
> 
> _than if I had related a dream._

And Leibniz lamented against the mathematicians, saying

> _For if praise is given to the men who have determined the number of regular solids - which is of no use, except insofar as it is pleasant to contemplate - and if it is thought to be an exercise worthy of a mathematical genius to have brought to light the more elegant properties of a conchoid or cissoid, or some other figure which rarely has any use, how much better will it be to bring under mathematical laws human reasoning, which is the most excellent and useful thing we have._

And he was a voice of One shouting in the wilderness.

And Leibniz spoke of the Universal Character[^8] that would come after him,

And which would be brought by a young man.

> _If I had been less distracted, or if I were younger, or assisted by well disposed young men, I could hope to give a sample of \[my Universal Character\]… It is very difficult to form or create[^9] such a language or character[^10], but very easy to learn..._

And Leibniz[^11] said,

> Prepare the way for the Universal Character,
>
> And make his paths straight,
> 
> For his ways are not straight.
> 
> But they are the ways of men.
