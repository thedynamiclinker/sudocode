<span style="font-size: 64pt; line-height: 1em; float: left; padding-right: 1px">T</span>he beginning of the story of A.M.T.[^1] the Martyr, Son of Mathematics[^2], Father of Computing,[^3] who alone found the key to the seven[^26] sealed[^4] mysteries[^5] of the National Extroverts[^6], enemies of darkness,[^7] who saved us from the Great War that did cover all the world, and who died for[^8] our faults.[^9]

As it was written in the book T.M.A.[^10] by Leibniz,[^25] in the eighty sixth year of the seventeenth century of the old calendar,[^11]

> _It is unworthy of excellent men_
>
> _to lose hours like slaves_
>
> _in the labour of calculation_
>
> _which could safely be relegated_
>
> _to anyone if machines were used._

And Leibniz spoke of a Logos[^12] that would come after him,

That would be a Universal Way.

Of Writing and able to express within it All Things.

That are in us[^13] for out[^14] of Writing[^15],

All that was ever Written was made.

> _… \[A\]ʟᴀɴguage or universal writing,_
> 
> _infinitely different from all hitherto projected,_
> 
> _because the very characters[^16]_
> 
> _would guide the reason;_
> 
> _and errors, except those of fact,_
> 
> _would be only errors of computation._

And in the fifteenth year of the eighteenth century of the old calendar,

Leibniz, who was also called God's peace,[^17]

lamented against the scholars, saying

> _I have spoken of my \[Logos\] to others,_
> 
> _but they have given it no more attention_
> 
> _than if I had related a dream._

And Leibniz lamented against the mathematicians, saying

> _For if praise is given to the men who have determined the number of regular solids - which is of no use, except insofar as it is pleasant to contemplate - and if it is thought to be an exercise worthy of a mathematical genius to have brought to light the more elegant properties of a conchoid or cissoid, or some other figure which rarely has any use, how much better will it be to bring under mathematical laws human reasoning, which is the most excellent and useful thing we have._

And he was a voice of One shouting in the wilderness.

And Leibniz spoke of the Universal Character[^18] that would come after him,

And which would be brought by a young man, who had not been known by a woman.

> _If I had been less distracted, or if I were younger, or assisted by well disposed young men, I could hope to give a sample of \[my Universal Character\]… It is very difficult to form or create[^19] such a language or character[^20], but very easy to learn..._

And Leibniz[^21] said,

> Prepare the way for the Universal Character,
>
> And make his paths straight,
> 
> For his ways are not straight.
> 
> But they are the ways of men.

And the Universal Character came into the world, in the form of a man.

And he[^22] was called $\forall$, because he was for all.

And he was called T, because he was the end.[^23]

And he was called A, because he was the beginning.[^24]

[^1]: The word Alan, of Celtic and Breton origins, can mean "handsome" or "cheerful" (from Irish), "little rock" or "pebble" (from Gaelic), or "fox" (from Breton). It may also come from a word meaning "noble".

[^2]: T.N. We have translated the phrase Λογική τοῦ πένας (Lit. Logic of the pen) as "Mathematics." The original phrase is rather hard to capture in all its connotations, which include a suggestion of "leaving marks on a clean page," and "rough or manual human labor," among others.

[^3]: T.N. We have translated the phrase Λογικὴ τοῦ φωτός (Lit. Logic of the light) as "computing," in the interest of parallelism. Cf. n. [^23] supra.
[^4]: Lit. encrypted.

[^5]: Lit. Enigma.

[^6]: Lit. "National Social We The People's Work Party," though even the original text appears unsure about the choice of words here, which wording itself appears to have been a translation from a still earlier text. The O.T. here is heavily noted, having one footnote per word, with the single exception of the phrase "We The People," about which translation the O.T. shows a unique confidence. Here we see a rare case of the O.T. itself citing the DRWFEROTMSOHK, which quote we now insert in its entirety for reference. Quote: The English name "Germany" comes from the Latin word Germania, which the Romans used for the region east of the Rhine River. The German name for the country, Deutschland, comes from the Old High German word diutisc, meaning "of the people" or "of the people's land". Unquote. The O.T. then adds in the margin: "Not to be confused with the modern Nation of We The People's After-Work Social Party, which has been increasingly attended recently, to whom it may concern." Meaning unclear.

[^7]: Lit. "lovers of light" in the original, though most translators are not sure what to make of this and are clearly uncomfortable including it without some linguistic circumlocutions.

[^8]: O.T. has "from" or "due to" or "and it was" depending on the source.

[^9]: Or: our fault.

[^10]: Or: The _Machina Arithmetica._

[^11]: i.e., 1685.

[^12]: Or: Logic.

[^13]: Or: in the mind.
[^14]: Sic?
[^15]: Or: Words.

[^16]: O.T. has here an ellipsis.

[^17]: Lit. "Gottfried", a Germanic name composed of the elements "gott" (God) and "fried" (peace or protection), evolved from the Old High German name Godafrid.
[^18]: Or: Characteristic.

[^19]: O.T. has "invent."

[^20]: O.T. has "characteristic."

[^21]: O.T. has "it was."

[^22]: O.T. has "it" here.

[^23]: The final letter of the Hebrew alphabet is ת, equivalent to the Latin alphabet's letter T in its phonetics, and equivalent to the letter Z in its ordering. Cf. Ω in Greek. The O.T. has the lowercase Latin letter here. Translated as uppercase for consistency with the last line.

[^24]: O.T. appends "of the 0ld ways, and of the ν", omitted for clarity because I'm sorry but it makes no goddamn sense.

[^25]: The O.T. uses the sign ΓL, a Greek capital gamma followed by a Latin capital L, to refer to the philosopher, mathematician, and foundationally minded polymath more commonly known as Leibniz. The translation substitutes "Leibniz" for clarity.

[^26]: The use of the number seven here has generated some debate. We outline the most plausible hypotheses here. (1) The Enigma machine, invented in 1918, uses seven alphabet substitutions via rotors to achieve seven alphabet substitutions between input and output letters. This is perhaps the most plausible interpretation. (2) The International Museum of World War II near Boston has seven Enigma machines on display. Scholars who date this document's Authorship to later periods have argued that this fact was misunderstood by the Authors to suggest that only seven Enigma machines still existed or ever existed. (3) There is a similar set of seven Enigma machines on display at the National Cryptologic Museum, an American museum of cryptologic history that is affiliated with the National Security Agency (NSA), pictured below. The reason for the choice of the number seven is unknown, and is mostly only discussed by the types of folks who have a screw or two loose internally, if you catch my drift.
