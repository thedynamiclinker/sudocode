## 2: Gifts

This is the record of the genealogy of Al,

Who came to study under Al,

And was Doctored by him,

In the Town of Princes.

These are[^1] the two for whom the place [^2] is named.

Al was the descendant[^3] of Al, son of Sam, son of Al, son of Al.

Veblen was enthroned[^4] of the department,

before he came to direct the IAS.[^5]

Alonzo Church was there.

Kurt Gödel was visiting in 1933 and again in 1934, and by the end of the 1930s he was a permanent member of faculty of the Institute for Advanced Study.

And throughout the 1930s, the Institute for Advanced Study shared its quarters with the mathematicians until it got its own campus about a mile away.

And John von Neumann was also there from the beginning of the 1930s.

And various physicists were also there who are not really relevant to our story.

Oswald Veblen's graduate students included Alonzo Church.

And aside from Church's PhD students, Veblen's PhD students included Philip Franklin, whose student Alan Perlis had students like David Parnas, who Barbara Liskov mentioned this morning as one of the very important people in the development of programming methodology.

Zohar Manna, a prominent logician in computer science, Kai Li, a systems builder, Jeannette Wing, and five hundred other computer scientists accorsing to the Mathematics Genealogy database.

Veblen has more than 8,000 PhD descendants overall, so only a small fraction of them are computer science, and many of them are mathematicians and people in operations research and statistics and so on.

And also what Veblen was doing in the 1930s and 40s was to help oversee the development of the ENIAC computer - well, we can call it a "computer"; it's a calculator, it's not really universal, but it was enormously influential because its technology was quite important.

Solomon Lefschetz had thousands of PhD descendants. His students include John McCarthy, the inventor of Lisp, for which he won the Turing Award in 1971.

John Tukey, one of the most eminent statisticians of the 20th century - who, I believe, invented the word "bit" and the word "software" if I'm not mistaken.

Ralph Gomory, who was the head of IBM Research;

Richard Bellman, inventor of dynamic programming;

And, you know, 6,000 other PhD descendants including:

John Nash.

Marvin Minsky: Turing Award, 1969.

Manuel Blum: Turing Award, 1995.

Barbara Liskov, who we heard from this afternoon [Turing Award, 2008].

Gerald Sussman.

Shafi Goldwasser [Turing Award, 2012].

Umesh and Vijay Vazirani, Persi Diaconis, and Peter Buneman, who I’ll bet many of you have never heard of, but who did important work in programming languages.

And Alonzo Church was also a mathematician [sic] in the Department of Computer Science, eh, excuse me, [sic] Mathematics, in the 1930s.

His students included Alan Turing, of course.

Leon Henkin.

Stephen Kleene.

Martin Davis.

Michael Rabin: Turing Award [1976].

Dana Scott: Turing Award [1976].

Barkley Rosser.

And whose PhD descendants include 3,000 other mathematicians and computer scientists including:

Robert Constable.

Ed Clarke: Turing Award winner [2007].

Allen Emerson: Turing Award [2007]

And Leslie Valiant: Turing Award [2010].

Kurt Gödel was in the building during various years of that time although he didn’t overlap with the time of Turing’s visit, which was a great disappointment to Turing.

And Gödel had no Ph.D. students, but of course his work had enormous influence on the fields of mathematics and computer science.

Not just his incompleteness results in logic, but really the notion that syntax and data structures are just numbers.

And that's really what makes the universal computer possible.

John von Neumann was at Princeton University from 1930 and a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study from 1933, which meant he stayed in the same building until the end of the decade.

He had only a few students, including a pioneer in parallel computer architecture Donald Gillies who was a professor at the University of Illinois in the 1950s and 60s - and who was actually a neighbor of mine. I used to play in the yard with his son when I was a child. He died quite young, of a heart attack.

In 1931, Von Neumann was really the first to recognize the significance of Gödel’s work, and towards 1950 - late 1940s really - he was the one that really brought Turing's notions of universality, of stored-program computers, of "programs are just data" into the (American) practical world of computational devices.

And we can argue about whether this would have happened anyway, but I think that this work of Turing and von Neumann's appreciation of it and action on it speeded things up by at least ten years, and probably more.

So, you know, the students and descendants of just Veblen and Lefschetz include five of the first thirty years worth of Turing Award winners.

And five of the next thirty years of Turing award winners.

Those mathematicians in old Fine Hall in the 1930s had an enormous influence on what became computer science.

So anyway, Max Newman had suggested to Turing that [Princeton] was where he ought to go, to learn how to integrate himself into the world of Mathematical Logic.

So here’s his letter to Luther Eisenhart, the dean of the Graduate School at Princeton University - and later chair of the mathematics department:

> "Thank you for letting me know about accommodations in the Graduate School. Would you be so kind as to engage one of the suites you describe?"

So Turing came in 1936 for a visit that was originally envisioned as a year.

In the end it stretched to two years, at the end of which he completed his PhD.

So in year one, he proved the equivalence between the Turing machine and lambda calculus - unifying these models of computation - and published a paper on that as an addendum to his big 1936 paper.

He also built an electromechanical binary multiplier - he went over to the machine shop and made the relays himself - and proved a few other results in mathematics, and started on his PhD thesis. He went back to England for the summer.

So there were these three models of computation, by 1936–37.

There were the Herbrand–Gödel recursive functions, which Gödel had proposed as a fairly general way of expressing effective computability.

There was the lambda calculus

[^1]: Non-standard spelling "θεσ ις" in the original translated "these are" rather than the more literal "thes is" \[sic\] for clarity. Perhaps a pun on the use of "θεσις" later in the same line.

[^2]: Lit. "θεσις." From late Middle English, via late Latin from Greek, literally ‘placing, a proposition’, from the root of tithenai ‘to place’.

[^3]: Lit. student or understudy.

[^4]: Lit. "was the chair." In some sources, "was the head."

[^5]: The IAS was founded by [Abraham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Flexner), and by [Louis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Bamberger)[^6] grandson of [Moses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Hutzler) the founder of [Har Sinai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Har_Sinai_%E2%80%93_Oheb_Shalom_Congregation) (Lit. "Mount Sinai" in Heb.). They selected Veblen, an expert in the sciences of Earth Measurement[^7] and the Study of Place,[^8] to help the IAS to acquire the surrounding lands for its original people, and to prepare the way for future territorial expansion into the surrounding areas. The selection of the Norwegian Veblen was a shrewd and cunning decision, given his background, and the background of Norwegian people more generally, vis-a-vis their long history as a raiding people. Though the original pronunciation of IAS is unknown, some inferences can be made from the composition of its founders. Though is known with certainty, the Yahwistic influence is clear, at least in these earliest strata of the IAS's history. From shared names of the IAS's founders with the Abrahamic and Mosaic patriarchs, to the direct mention of Har Sinai (הַר סִינַי‬‎), to the association with warrior imagery, land raids, and the glory of battle, we believe the most plausible approach is to simply take this evidence at face value, and conjecture that it is not unlikely that the group's name for themselves (IAS) derives from יאס or perhaps יהס, meaning "Yah's" or "That which belongs to Yah," with an original pronounciation of /ias/ (IPA), and with colloquial spellings including "yassss" and "YAS!", among countless others. Unsurprisingly, given the heavily Yahwist influence, the group's name "IAS" was rarely pronounced by members, who preferred to refer to it as "I-A-S", naming each letter without requiring one to pronounce the trigram itself, presumably as a sign of respect, a behavior common in Yahwistic traditions.

[^6]: From the Old French name _Loois_, which is a form of the Old Germanic name Ludwig. It is composed of two elements: _hlūdaz_ ("famous" or "loud") and _wīg_ ("war" or "battle"), making the meaning of the name "famous warrior" or "glorious in battle".

[^7]: Middle English: via Old French from Latin _geometria_, from Greek, from _gē_ ‘earth’ + _metria_ (see _-metry_).

[^8]: Mid 19th century: via German from Greek _topos_ ‘place’ + _-logy_.
