## 2: Gifts

These are the records of the genealogy of Al,

Who came to study under Al,

And was Doctored by him, In the Town of Princes.

These are[^1] the two for whom the place[^2] is named.

---

Al was the descendant[^3] of Al, son of Sam, son of Al, son of Al.

And Veblen was enthroned[^4] of the department.

And he abdicated his throne, to follow[^5] IAS[^6] by leading the people of IAS to new lands.[^7]

And Al was there.

And John[^11] was there from the beginning of that decade.

And Veblen advised Al, and Phil (whose advised Al[^12] (who himself advised David (whose praises were sung by Barbara[^13] in the morning this was written.))

And Veblen had more than 8,000 descendants overall.

And Solomon had thousands of descendants.

And Solomon's descendents included John,[^14] John,[^15] Ralph who led the IBMR,[^16] and Dick the dynamic.

And, to your knowledge,[^17] 6,000 other PhD descendants including John,[^18] Marvin the Al Rewarded,[^19] Manuel the Al Rewarded. Barbara the Al Rewarded, who spoke this very day, Gerald, Shafi the Al Rewarded, Umesh and Vijay, Persi, and Peter the lesser known.

And Al was a mathematician.[^20]

His students included Al, Leon, Stephen, Martin, Michael the Al Rewarded, Dana the Al Rewarded, and Barkley.

And whose descendants include 3,000 others including Robert, Edmund the Al Awarded, Allen the Al Awarded, and Leslie the Al Awarded.[^21]

God (El) was in the building in that time, though he did not appear to Al, which was a great disappointment to Al.

And God (El) had no descendants, but of course his works are enormous in their influence upon the fields.

God (El) showed us the Incompleteness of the Word,[^22] and the Universality of Number.

It was this which made possible the Universal Character.[^23]

In the year that the Word was shown to be Incomplete, John saw in God (El)'s work a significance not seen by others, and he was the first to bring Al's works to the practical minds of men.[^24]

And we may quarrel, asking whether these thing would have come to pass without these things.

But it is clear to me that the works of Al, and the light that was seen in them by John and brought to light under the standing lamp of that light of understanding,[^25]

and their acts have brought forth the flow of time to a speed of greater than a decade.[^26]

And Al came in the Year of Paper[^27].

And he stayed here.

In the first year, he wrote that λ[^28] was universal.

In the second year, he was Doctored.

And he returned to his old parents in the country.[^29]

Thanks be to God![^30]

For at last our work is done.[^31]

Give offerings in this place. For the Tower of Ivory does not draw within it the riches of this world. And only through thine offerings doth the Λογος draw still the breath of life.[^32]

[^1]: Non-standard spelling "θεσ ις" in the original translated "these are" rather than the more literal "thes is" \[sic\] for clarity. Perhaps a pun on the use of "θεσις" later in the same line.

[^2]: Lit. "θεσις." From late Middle English, via late Latin from Greek, literally ‘placing, a proposition’, from the root of tithenai ‘to place’.

[^3]: Lit. student or understudy.

[^4]: Lit. "was the chair." In some sources, "was the head."

[^5]: O.T. has only the clause that follows, "leading the people of IAS." The clause here "to follow IAS" has been added for clarity, to distinguish "the people of IAS" from the more abstract and intangible concept of IAS itself. Cf. n. [^6] for more details on IAS and its people.

[^6]: The IAS was founded by [Abraham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Flexner), and a Famous Warrior[^8] grandson of [Moses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Hutzler), founder of [Har Sinai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Har_Sinai_%E2%80%93_Oheb_Shalom_Congregation) (Lit. "Mount Sinai" in Heb.). They selected Veblen, an expert in the sciences of Earth Measurement[^9] and the Logic of Places,[^10] to help the IAS acquire the surrounding lands for its original people, and to prepare the way for future territorial expansion into the surrounding areas (source: [here](https://www.ias.edu/acquiring-land)). The selection of the Norwegian Veblen was a shrewd and cunning decision, given his background, and the background of the Norwegian people more generally, vis-a-vis their long history as a raiding people known for their skill in the quick acquisition of lands. Though the original pronunciation of IAS is unknown, some inferences can be made from the composition of its founders. Though little is known with certainty, the Yahwistic influence is clear, at least in these earliest strata of the IAS's history. From shared names of the IAS's founders with the Abrahamic and Mosaic patriarchs, to the direct mention of Har Sinai (הַר סִינַי‬‎), to the association with warrior imagery, land raids, and the glory of battle, we believe the most plausible approach is to simply take this evidence at face value, and conjecture that it is not unlikely that the group's name for themselves (IAS) derives from יאס or perhaps יהס, meaning "Yah's" or "That which belongs to Yah," with an original pronounciation of /ias/ (IPA), and with colloquial spellings including "yassss" and "YAS!", among countless others. Unsurprisingly, given the heavily Yahwist influence, the group's name "IAS" was rarely pronounced by members, who preferred to refer to it as "I-A-S", naming each letter without requiring one to pronounce the trigram itself, presumably as a sign of respect, a behavior common in Yahwistic traditions.

[^7]: Cf. n. [^6] for details on the acquisition of lands.

[^8]: The name [Louis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Bamberger), from the Old French name _Loois_, which is a form of the Old Germanic name Ludwig. It is composed of two elements: _hlūdaz_ ("famous" or "loud") and _wīg_ ("war" or "battle"), making the meaning of the name "famous warrior" or "glorious in battle".

[^9]: Middle English: via Old French from Latin _geometria_, from Greek, from _gē_ ‘earth’ + _metria_ (see _-metry_).

[^10]: Mid 19th century: via German from Greek _topos_ ‘place’ + _-logy_.

[^11]: Most likely von Neumann.

[^12]: Probably Perlis.

[^13]: A name that means "Foreigner" or "Stanger in a strange land." Cf. Gershom in Heb.

[^14]: Probably McCarthy.

[^15]: No idea.

[^16]: Meaning unknown. יבמר does not appear to be a word in Hebrew or in any other abjad familiar to the translators.

[^17]: Lit. "you know" in the original.

[^18]: The translators would like to express their frustration at the abundance of Johns before we proceed.

[^19]: Perhaps "Al Honors him" or "Blessed of Al." At this point in the genealogy we begin to see Al used as a theophoric element in the names of notable individuals in the line of descent that traces back to Al, Al, Veblen, and eventually to the above mentioned Abraham and Moses.

[^20]: Sic.

[^21]: The genealogy stops here, and the document appears to transition to an Author with a very different style, as can be seen by the heavy emphasis on God (אל) below.

[^22]: Lit. Logos. Logic in some sources.

[^23]: "Machine" in O.T.

[^24]: The document now switches to an almost exclusive emphasis on Al, perhaps another change of Author.

[^25]: What?

[^26]: Since a decade is not in fact a measure of speed, this phrase appears to be a metaphor whose meaning was turned upside down and multiplied with the lengths of history since its publication.

[^27]: Lit. "year of his paper" (archaic).

[^28]: Poss. abbrev. of λογος.

[^29]: Lit. "The parent country of the old country" in the orig. text. Repetition omitted in translation to conform to the typical structure of English prose.

[^30]: Lit. "Thank God!"

[^31]: Lit. "We're finally done with work."

[^32]: Translator's Note: This paragraph -- a clear request for donations, a lament that the author doesn't make enough money, and what appears to be a thinly veiled threat that if you don't donate, "Logic dies" -- appears to have been added much later by an institutional author of the old academy, before the death of academia, along with the two verses preceeding it. Though the style clearly diverges both in form and content from the rest of the document, these verses have nevertheless become part of the canon of Academic Law in at least like half of interpretive traditions, so we reproduce it here in the interest of completeness.
