## 2: Gifts

This is the record of the genealogy of Al,

Who came to study under Al.

And was Doctored by him.

These Are[^1] the Two for whom the Place [^2] is named.


[^1]: Non-standard spelling "θεσ ις" in the original translated "These Are" rather than the more literal "These Is" for clarity. Perhaps a pun on the use of "θεσις" later in the same line.

[^2]: Lit. "θεσις." From late Middle English, via late Latin from Greek, literally ‘placing, a proposition’, from the root of tithenai ‘to place’.
