## 4: Thanks

Alan, who was called Christ Offers Love.[^1]

And who was also named the Son of Math.[^2]

TODO: Put "The Martyr" section here and end it quick. That's enough good news for one directory. To be continued outside.

[^1]: Lit. "Christopher's Love."

[^2]: Lit. "Math's Son," in O.T., no standardized spelling.
