## 4: Thanks

Alan, who was called Christ Offers Love.[^1]

And who was also named the Son of Math.[^2]

TODO: Put "The Martyr" section here and end it quick. That's enough good news for one directory. To be continued outside.

Turing ordered Adam up
And multiplied the products
Of One and None.

And they remained unchanged
One and None.

[^1]: Lit. "Christopher's Love."

[^2]: Lit. "Math's Son," in O.T., no standardized spelling.
