## 4: Thanks

Alan, who was called Christ Offers Love.[^1]

And who was also named the Son of Math.[^2]

And Alan was asked "Can that which is not living be said to think?"
And he replied "When it is said to think, it will be said to think."

And Alan was asked "What is machine intelligence?"
And he replied "It is not the intelligence of machines."

And Alan said "First do whatever is possible through the normal channels."
And they asked "What should we do when our needs go unheard?"
And he replied "Then do whatever is possible outside the normal channels."

And Alan said "Cursed is he who lies with men."
And they waited for him to explain.
And he was silent.

[^1]: Lit. "Christopher's Love."

[^2]: Lit. "Math's Son," in O.T., no standardized spelling.
