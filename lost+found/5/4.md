## 4: Grace

Alan, who was called Christ Offers Love.[^1]

And who was also named the Son of Math.[^2]

Came into the world, and to A Church in the town of Princes.

And there was a man with Church who was Clean.

He was with Church in the beginning.

But he was not Alan.

Now this was Al’s testimony when the leaders in the IAS sent A Cohen and A Levine to ask him who he was.

He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, “I am not Alan.”

They asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Clean?”

He said, “I am not.”

“Are you the Göd  (El)?”

He answered, “No.”

Finally they said, “Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”

Al replied in the words of Gott, “”

Came to a park that was called Bletchey,

And spoke to the people.

And Alan was asked "That which is not living, can it be said to think?"

And he replied "When it is said to think, but no sooner, it will be said to think."

And Alan was asked "What is machine intelligence?"

And he replied "It is not simply the intelligence of machines."

But the people did not understand what Alan was saying.

And Alan said "First do whatever is possible through the official channels."

And they asked "What should we do when our needs go unheard?"

And he replied "Then do whatever is possible outside of them."

And Alan said "Cursed is he who lies with men."

And they waited for him to explain, expecting to hear a reason.

And he was silent.
