## 3: Light

In the seventh year of the twentieth century of the Old Calendar,

On the sixth month and the twenty third day of that year,[^1]

In the parent country of the old country,

Turing was born around tea time, a native of tea.[^2]

And Turing was a liar, primarily to[^3] men,

And had a strong affect on[^4] these men.

Because of his lying and secrecy with them.

And Turing wrote his works and sent them out.

And they were heard by Al, who accepted him.

And Turing said,

> God is good![^5]
>
> Let my life be given to you.[^6]
>
> Let me be taken[^7] to church.

And Turing went to Church,

And he stayed there for two years.

And he was Doctored.[^8]



[^1]: Though June 23rd has become universally recognized as a holy day in the modern era, some have suggested that the reason for this holiday should not be assumed to be the exact historical date of Turing's birth. Historicity aside, this date has more than any other become a symbol of the people who trace their origins to the stories contained in the documents that have since come to be called Sudo code.

[^2]: The choice of "of" here was made only after much disagreement among the translators as to the original intended meaning. Where we have written "of," the O.T. has an obscure symbol /ʔ/ with the words "glottal stop" in the margin and "ipa" annotated beside, the latter of which is presumably a reference to the British East India Tea Company, as Turing's father (Julius Mathison Turing) was, around this time, on leave from his position with the Indian Civil Service (ICS) of the British Raj government at Chatrapur, then in the Madras Presidency and presently in Odisha state, in India, and said company was the same that is well known from other sources to have pioneered the popular high-proof beverage known as India Pale Ale (IPA for short) originating in the United Kingdom for export to India, which was under the control of the same British East India Company until 1858. The higher hop content of IPA acted as a natural preservative, preventing it from spoiling during the long shipping voyage, so despite the paucity of details in the source text, the data provided by these and other extra-textual sources are sufficiently tight in their correlation with the otherwise unclear information in the source material that we can be reasonably sure that's what they were on about, said sources including (but not limited to) The (information presently in the) Dynamic Read-Writable Free Encyclopedic Repository of the Modern State of Human Knowledge, ca. 0x08 P.A., New Calendar.

[^3]: Lit. "primarily with" \[sic\] in the Original Text.

[^4]: From Latin _affectus_ meaning variously "to attack" (c. 1600), or meaning "disposition, mood, state of mind or body," a noun use of the adjective _affectus_ meaning "disposed, constituted, inclined towards." Cf. present-participle adjective form _affecting_, "having power to move or excite the feelings."

[^5]: Lit. "Good God!"

[^6]: Active voice in the original. Passive used here for emphasis on the heavily dramatic tone of this passage.

[^7]: Lit. "Take me"

[^8]: Or: "his name was Doctored."

[^9]: "He" in the original.
