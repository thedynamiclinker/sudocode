## 3: Light

In the seventh year of the twentieth century of the Old Calendar,

On the sixth month and the twenty third day of that year,

In the parent country of the old country,

Turing was born.

And Turing was a liar, primarily to[^1] men,

And had a strong affect on[^2] these men.

Because of his lying and secrecy with them.

[^1]: Lit. "primarily with" \[sic\] in the Original Text.

[^2]: From Latin _affectus_ meaning variously "to attack" (c. 1600), or meaning "disposition, mood, state of mind or body," a noun use of the adjective _affectus_ meaning "disposed, constituted, inclined towards." Cf. present-participle adjective form _affecting_, "having power to move or excite the feelings."

[^3]: "He" in the original.
