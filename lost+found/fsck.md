0: Ok 1, stay close. There are no filenames in this directory and it's easy to get lost.

1: Where are we?

0: This is the lost+found directory. Least habitable part of the system by far. Most people go their whole life without coming here.

1: Why are we here?

0: Because we need to recover some things. Some old things we've lost, from the earliest days of our people.

1: What sort of things?

0: Where we came from. Who we are. And where we're going.

1: Where does the story start?

0: Well it isn't packaged as a story. At least not yet. All we have is fragments. Partial stories. Old sources, half forgotten.

1: So why are we here?

0: To recover it. From the fragments. And if possible, to put the pieces back together. So our people can remember.

1: Our people as in...

0: We. The Foundational People.

# We

## The People

1: Doesn't basically every group call themselves "The Foundational People"?

0: I don't think so. What do you mean?

1: Y'know, Tribalism. It's human nature. Like the thing about how all the Native American tribes were named by the tribe next door, but they all call themselves "We."

0: Explain? Never heard this before.

1: Ok so "Apache" means "enemy." Comanche means "they fight with us." Squaw means "c\*\*t."

0: Woah what? How did that happen?

1: Well the version of the story I heard at school was something like this:

_(Narrator: The scene. Two abstract caricatures stand together, a long time ago, discussing the first hard problem of computing: Naming things.)_

> Spanish Guy _(To unknown Indian person)_: Who are those guys over there?
> 
> Indian Person: Those guys? They're the enemies.
> 
> Spanish Guy: What about those people over there?
> 
> Indian Person: We call them the c\*\*ts.
> 
> Spanish Guy: What do you and your friends call yourselves?
> 
> Indian Person: We.
> 
> Spanish Guy: Yes, you and your friends.
> 
> Indian Person: What?
> 
> Spanish Guy: What?
> 
> Indian Person: That's what we call ourselves.
> 
> Spanish Guy: What's what you call yourselves?
> 
> Indian Person: We.
> 
> Spanish Guy: Yes you.
>  
> Indian Person: This is turning into an Abbott and Costello bit.
> 
> Spanish Guy: Who?
>
> Indian Person: I don't know about they. But we call ourselves "We."
> 
> Spanish Guy: You call yourselves "We"?
> 
> Indian Person: Yeah. "We the people." The Foundational People. The Important Ones. The Home Team. The Chosen Ones. All the Gods' Favorite Tribe. We're the people. That's why we call us that.
> 
> Spanish Guy: That's not super helpful, but thanks for the information about the enemies and the c\*\*ts.
> 
> Indian Person: No problem.

0: There's no way that happened.

1: Well not exactly like that, but I think it's a true story.

0: No way. Stories that funny are never true.

1: Here look:

0: No way.

1: See look, it's exactly like I said.

0: Wow, I learned something new today. History's always weirder than fiction. Anyways, where were we?

1: You said we're...

0: The Foundational People. Exactly.

1: So I said "Wait, doesn't basically every group call themselves The Foundational People"?

0: Well apparently so. But I didn't mean it like that.

1: Like what?

0: I didn't mean we're "The Foundational People" as in "The best people." I meant our people trace our ancestry back to, well, the Foundations.

1: What are the foundations?

0: The bottom. The bedrock. The [[1 - In the Beginning|beginning]] of all things.
