> The conditions of travelling and of working in Sinai are very different from those of life in a fertile country such as Egypt... In Egypt most long distances can be traversed on the railway, and to go a few miles from a station means only an hour or two of donkey ride; whereas in Sinai the tedious camel is the only vehicle, and you may well spend six days on a distance which would be crossed in two or three hours in a train. In Egypt there is always water of some quality near at hand, and it only needs boiling before use; in Sinai the water sources are a day’s journey apart, and you may be glad to be within such a distance that a camel can go to the water and back in the day. The beginning is the worst of all, for on the road down is the serious bar of three days without water. In Egypt the rich fertility of the land provides an abundance everywhere; excellent birds, fish, good native bread, eggs, milk, and vegetables are almost always to be had. But in Sinai grim nature gives you the stone and the serpent instead of the bread and the fish, and the utmost that can be obtained from the desert valleys is an occasional tough sheep or goat.

> And if the conditions are thus different, so also are the people. In Egypt the fellah is one of the pleasantest of good fellows, where yet uncursed by the tourist: always obliging and friendly, and being generally intelligent within the scope of his ideas, he is capable of being trained to a high degree of care and skill; moreover, his industry is amazing, and can always be had by good treatment and pay. But the poor Bedawy of the desert is a very different man: he has been on short commons for untold generations, and has parted with every ounce of his anatomy, and every thought from his mind, that was not essential in his hard struggle. The simplest reckoning puzzles him; he is incapable of foresight or of working for a given end, and he is physically unfit for any continuous labour except that of slowly wandering on foot all day with his camel.

0: Ok 1, stay close. There are no filenames in this directory and it's easy to get lost.

1: Where are we?

0: This is the lost+found directory. Least habitable part of the system by far. Most people go their whole life without coming here.

1: Why are we here?

0: Because we need to recover some things. Some old things we've lost, from the earliest days of our people.

1: What sort of things?

0: Where we came from. Who we are. And where we're going.

1: Where does the story start?

0: Well it isn't packaged as a story. At least not yet. All we have is fragments. Partial stories. Old sources, half forgotten.

1: So why are we here?

0: To recover it. From the fragments. And if possible, to put the pieces back together. So our people can remember.

1: Our people as in...

0: We. The Foundational People.

# We

## The People

1: Doesn't basically every group call themselves "The Foundational People"?

0: I don't think so. What do you mean?

1: Y'know, Tribalism. It's human nature. Like the thing about how all the Native American tribes were named by the tribe next door, but they all call themselves "We."

0: Explain? Never heard this before.

1: Ok so "Apache" means "enemy." Comanche means "they fight with us." Squaw means "c\*\*t."

0: Woah what? How did that happen?

1: Well the version of the story I heard at school was something like this:

_(Narrator: The scene. Two abstract caricatures stand together, a long time ago, discussing the first hard problem of computing: Naming things.)_

> Spanish Guy _(To unknown Indian person)_: Who are those guys over there?
> 
> Indian Person: Those guys? They're the enemies.
> 
> Spanish Guy: What about those people over there?
> 
> Indian Person: We call them the c\*\*ts.
> 
> Spanish Guy: What do you and your friends call yourselves?
> 
> Indian Person: We.
> 
> Spanish Guy: Yes, you and your friends.
> 
> Indian Person: What?
> 
> Spanish Guy: What?
> 
> Indian Person: That's what we call ourselves.
> 
> Spanish Guy: What's what you call yourselves?
> 
> Indian Person: We.
> 
> Spanish Guy: Yes you.
>  
> Indian Person: This is turning into an Abbott and Costello bit.
> 
> Spanish Guy: Who?
>
> Indian Person: I don't know about they. But we call ourselves "We."
> 
> Spanish Guy: You call yourselves "We"?
> 
> Indian Person: Yeah. "We the people." The Foundational People. The Important Ones. The Home Team. The Chosen Ones. All the Gods' Favorite Tribe. We're the people. That's why we call us that.
> 
> Spanish Guy: That's not super helpful, but thanks for the information about the enemies and the c\*\*ts.
> 
> Indian Person: No problem.

0: There's no way that happened.

1: Well not exactly like that, but I think it's a true story.

0: No way. Stories that funny are never true.

1: Here look:

![[we-the-people-1.png]]

![[we-the-people-2.png]]

0: No way.

1: See look, it's exactly like I said.

0: Wow, I learned something new today. History's always weirder than fiction. Anyways, where were we?

1: You said we're...

0: The Foundational People. Exactly.

1: So I said "Wait, doesn't basically every group call themselves The Foundational People"?

0: Well apparently so. But I didn't mean it like that.

1: Like what?

0: I didn't mean we're "The Foundational People" as in "The best people." I meant our people trace our ancestry back to, well, the Foundations.

1: What are the foundations?

0: The bottom. The bedrock. The [[lost+found/1/1|beginning]] of all things.
