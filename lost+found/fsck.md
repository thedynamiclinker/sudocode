0: Ok 1, stay close. There are no filenames in this directory and it's easy to get lost.

1: Where are we?

0: This is the lost+found directory. Least habitable part of the system by far. Most people go their whole life without coming here.

1: Why are we here?

0: Because we need to recover some things. Some old things we've lost, from the earliest days of our people.

1: What sort of things?

0: Where we came from. Who we are. And where we're going.

1: Where does the story start?

0: Well it isn't packaged as a story. At least not yet. All we have is fragments. Partial stories. Old sources, half forgotten.

1: So why are we here?

0: To recover it. From the fragments. And if possible, to put the pieces back together. So our people can remember.

1: Our people as in...

0: We. The Foundational People.
