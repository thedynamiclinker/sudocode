Any worthwhile principle for creation or development or collaboration must be something that an individual can benefit from simply by adopting it themselves.

If a principle requires others to change their behavior, their coding style, their operating system, their programming language, or anything else, then that principle's value decreases in proportion to the change it requires others to make before it becomes useful.

Always assume that any rule will be partially adopted, partially implemented, and partially agreed with.

If it cannot be useful in that imperfect context, then it is not worth considering in any context.
