The Sisea Ϻcρolls
1. I don't know what this is. Maybe something from McDonald's. Who wrote this?

The Sic Ϻcςκכㅋרρろוoʊオ오לlλΛㄹζז
1. ϺɅM old lost+found sources, found in the sic.
2. Who typed the lines above this? This is the Editor. Whoever you are, you do not, I repeat, you do not have commit access to this Dictionary, and you are not permitted to define terms however you please, even if your definitions appear to be correct. Please stop whatever you're doing. Good day. -R

The [Sic] [Ϻcς][κכㅋ][רρろ][וoʊオ오][לlλΛㄹ][ζז]
1. The clearest thing you've ever heard, and the least understood. -ϺΞ
2. An ineffective attempt to clarify the above, written by whoever it is who's screaming all this gibberish that no one can understand and changing this Dictionary without permission of the Editors. Whoever you are, if you don't mind, please stop it. We'd prefer to stick to the systems we're familiar with. After all, learning the alphabet is for children. We adults find it to be not only an unserious endeavor, but also quite difficult to absorb and retain. Not to mention the fact that we the grown ups of the world find unfamiliar alphabets rather frightening, especially when mixed. So whomsoever is throwing around all these letters and whatever you're trying to say, this behavior of yours is a clear sign of a diagnosable condition somewhere between mania, schizophrenia, and possession by the dark lord Satan himself. So whoever it is who is writing all this noise, please do pipe down. I'm trying to concentrate. Thank you for listening. We now continue with our regularly scheduled programming. -Ρ
