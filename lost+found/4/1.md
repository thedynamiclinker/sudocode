This is the story of Göᴅᴇʟ

who is also called /dev/zero.

Göᴅᴇʟ was rude[^1] and rarely spoke, except to ask "why?"

For this reason his parents named him Herr Warum.[^2]

When Göᴅᴇʟ was grown he left Brünn[^3]

and went to Vienna, and he stayed there.

And Göᴅᴇʟ was skilled with the fairer sex

often coming to them and going out together and in cyclically.[^4]

And when Göᴅᴇʟ was 22 years old he was married.

His wife was named Adele and she was 29 years old.

And Göᴅᴇʟ's family was displeased

because Adele had been working as a dancer

dancing for gentlemen in the evenings at a club of gentlemen of the evenings[^5]

whose name was called Der Nachtfalter

which means Moth of the Night.

And Göᴅᴇʟ and Adele met there and were married.

And his parents were displeased

because she was seven years his senior.

And Göᴅᴇʟ said to Adele

Let us leave the land of my birth[^6] and go to the Town of Princes

Where there is a Cathedral[^7] noble and ready[^8]

from which a great quantity of Words[^9] are made known.[^10]

And Adele and Göᴅᴇʟ arrived.

And the Noble[^11] of the Church

[^1]: "Curt", in the original text, meaning "using or expressed in few words, in a way perceived as rude."

[^2]: German for "Mr Why."

[^3]: Now Brno, Czech Republic.

[^4]: Lit. "over and over" in the Orig. Text.

[^5]: O.T. has "Night club".

[^6]: Cf. Gen 12:1 footnote 2 in Richard Elliott Friedman, _Commentary on the Torah: With a New English Translation and the Hebrew Text_ (San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco, 2001)  (hereafter **_ComeT_**). Hebrew text cited according to Friedman’s edition; verse numbering follows the Masoretic tradition unless explicitly divergent. Any anomalies in transliteration are my own and should not be imputed to Friedman, his editor(s), or HarperSanFrancisco.

[^7]: The term "Cathedral" here is used to avoid a possible misunderstanding with the word "Church", since the latter is also the name of a logician later in the same story with whom Godel collaborates. In the original text, the same word is used for both.

[^8]: The O.T. here has "Alonzo", a term is of Spanish and Portuguese origin, derived from the Visigothic name "Adalfuns," which combines the elements "adal" meaning "noble" and "funs" meaning "ready" or "eager," thus signifying "noble and ready" or "eager for nobility."

[^9]: Lit. "logic", from late Middle English: via Old French _logique_ and late Latin _logica_ from Greek _logikē (tekhnē)_ ‘(art) of reason’, from _logos_ 'word, reason,' often transcribed as Word or the Word in relig. contexts.

[^10]: Past of inf. form "To make known." From Middle English (in the sense 'make generally known'): from the stem of Old French _puplier_, from Latin _publicare_ 'make public', from _publicus_. The O.T. has "published."

[^11]: Cf. n. [^8], supra. This is likely a distinct meaning of the same term discussed there. The O.T. has the same term in both places.
