0: When Gödel was a little kid, his parents nicknamed him "Mr. Why." Sound familiar?

1: No way! That was totally me!

0: Sounds like it. Though in a lot of ways he wasn't really like anybody.

0: He was super cautious. Like another planet level of caution. Eventually ended up starving himself to death out of fear of being poisoned.

1: Holy f---

0: But that's jumping way ahead. He wasn't always like that. That was toward the end, in the 1970s, when his wife was away in the hospital.

1: Why did he starve himself?

0: He only trusted food that came from Adele. He really needed her around. They were great together.

1: That's a cute quote. What's this from?

0: From here:

0: Big book of all the stuff Gödel ever wrote. There's commentary by a bunch of logicians before each paper. Everyone's pretty much unanimous that he was the top logician of the century, probably ever.

0: But we're getting ahead of ourselves again. Let's rewind back to the early days.

1: When's the early days?

0: Well Hilbert's problems were 1900. Then Church was born in 1903. Now Gödel gets born in 1906, so let's start from there.

1: "he excelled particularly in mathematics, languages, and religion"?

0: Is that a question?

1: Just wondering how you always manage to make everything about religion.

0: You realize I didn't cause Gödel's life to happen right?

1: Just saying it's a suspicious pattern.
