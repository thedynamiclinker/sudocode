## Mr. Why

0: Dear 1,

1: Why are you being weird?

0: I'd like to introduce you to someone.

1: Um, ok.

0: Someone whose parents used to call him by the nickname Mr. Why.

1: Solid name. Who is it?

0: The next member of our trinity.

0: When Gödel was a little kid, his parents nicknamed him "Mr. Why." Sound familiar?

1: No way! That was totally me!

0: Sounds like it. Though in a lot of ways he wasn't really like anybody.

0: He was super cautious. Like another planet level of caution. Eventually ended up starving himself to death out of fear of being poisoned.

1: Holy f---

0: But that's jumping way ahead. He wasn't always like that. That was toward the end, in the 1970s, when his wife was away in the hospital.

1: Why did he starve himself?

0: He only trusted food that came from Adele. He really needed her around. They were great together.

1: That's a cute quote. What's this from?

0: From here:

![[godel-collected-works-001.png|400]]

0: Big book of all the stuff Gödel ever wrote. There's commentary by a bunch of logicians before each paper. Everyone's pretty much unanimous that he was the top logician of the century, probably ever.

0: But we're getting ahead of ourselves again. Let's rewind back to the early days.

1: When's the early days?

0: Well Hilbert's problems were 1900. Then Church was born in 1903. Now Gödel gets born in 1906, so let's start from there.

![[godel-collected-works-012.png]]

1: "he excelled particularly in mathematics, languages, and religion"?

0: Is that a question?

1: Just wondering how you always manage to make everything about religion.

0: You realize I didn't cause Gödel's life to happen right?

1: Just saying it's a suspicious pattern.

0: Sure whatever. Ok so, WWI happens. And, it's hard to overstate this, but basically the end of civilization begins.

0: He meets his wife when he's 21, and his parents are not happy.

1: Why not?

0: Well Kurt is soft spoken, to say the least. He basically never talks. His wife, on the other hand, is a, well, a "dancer."

1: What's wrong with being a dancer?

0: I mean like a "night club dancer."

1: Oh!

0: Plus she was already divorced, and was 6 years older than him.

1: Doesn't seem so bad.

0: It wasn't. Apparently they were perfect together.
