## (4,5): The Second Law of Numbers

### Or: Dudetheyreontome[^1]

And Gödel was lonely in Princeton.

Because Adele was not with him.

So he could not clear his mind.

And his family continued to disapprove her.

And in the thirty fourth year of the twentieth century of the Old Calendar,

Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany.

The next year, Gödel returned to Vienna.

Crossing the ocean with[^2] the King of S.S.[^3]

And H.H. his mentor died in that year.

Around this time Gödel was attacked by a man named[^4] Angstanfall, who was also called Schwächender.

And Gödel left Vienna and went to Purkersdorf.

And he stayed there.

Then Gödel's family met Angstanfall too, though he did not attack them.

And his family was worried, because they feared he might kill him.[^5]

And he left him.[^6]

And Gödel left Purkersdorf, and he recovered.

The next year, Angstanfall found him and he was attacked.

And Gödel went to _Breitenstein am Semmering_ 80km[^7] southwest of Vienna.

At the beginning of the tenth month of that year, Gödel returned to Princeton.

And he planned to stay for some time.

And Gödel quit and left his post,

After forty days and forty nights.

And returned to Vienna.

In this period his interest in sanatoria continued.

And he visited several, including Purkersdorf, his first.

And in the thirty seventh year of the twentieth century of the Old Calendar,

Gödel had what was called The Disastrous Year,

Which occured in Neunzehnhundertsechsunddreißig.

Then Gödel postponed his planned lectures more than once,

As he became more interested in visits to sanatoria.

He visited Rekawinkel.

And he rested in this home.

Which was 12km west of Purkersdorf.

And Angstanfall returned to Gödel.

And Gödel feared he would be poisoned.

But he was not shocked.

For he had left his post, and only post was shocked, but Gödel was not, because he escaped this shock when he left that post.

And Gödel had seen the definition of all computation.

But he did not see that he had seen.

For he had not yet heard of Al.

And in the thirty eighth year of the twentieth century of the Old Calendar,

Gödel returned to work.

He corresponded with John.

And John came to Vienna and visited him.

And the two exchanged Words.[^8]

And Gödel was finally with Adele.

And they lived together as partners in life.

And Gödel was unafraid to eat the food she made for him.

And they were blissfully alone, in spendid isolation.

And the life returned to Gödel, and he escaped from Angstanfall.

And Gödel went back to Princeton the following year.
