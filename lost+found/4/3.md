Princeton, 24./VIII. 1956.

Dearest Mama!

Last week I began writing a letter to you, but then abandoned it. My hand does not want to write this time. It weighs on me that I have had to disappoint you a second time about my coming. This time the fault lies the very least with me. At this point I cannot even say when I will be able to come except that the doctor said it would be best next Spring.
```

Today I had a strange dream about you. We were in New York together in an enormous hotel and kept riding up and down in the elevator. By the end we were balancing together on an exterior window sill on the 20th floor. But nothing happened.
```

```
I mainly did not send you the piece about me in Scientific American because my picture is so miserable. A press photographer came to see me at the Institute and took ca. 50 shots of me, supposedly to be sure that at least one really good one would be among them. In fact they apparently chose the worst one. For there were some really good ones among which I was sent one.

I am glad that Morgenstern’s visit offered you a pleasant diversion and that
he told you so much about me and so vividly. That little Karl is very nice and
well behaved, that is true. I did not even write you yet that our parakeets have
a chick, which now is already all grown up and quite tame. It flies onto one’s
finger and one can pet it. Is that not charming? When it arrived it was only 2
cm long and lay the entire time with its beak on the floor of the incubator.
Now it is the fattest and strongest of all three of them.

Adele’s mother is doing very well and she likes it here very much. Adele
let go of the girl and the gardener and does all the work alone. And she even is
painting the kitchen furniture and renovating the cellar so that I cannot explain
to myself where she gets the energy for all that.
```

```
Yesterday I saw Eisenhower on the television, when he held the speech on
the occasion of his nomination. He looks stronger and more energetic than
ever despite his two illnesses. What do you have to say about the collision of
the Andrea Doria? Both the ships supposedly diverted toward the same side. Is
that not ludicrous?
```

```
Enclosed I am sending you the congratulatory message from the Vienna
Municipal Council. So far not one of my letters to you have gotten lost. If you
want, you can send it back by registered mail, by the way.

	Thousand Bussis, also from Adele and her mother

	ever Your Kurt.
	
P.S. Of course Adele is neglecting her correspondence entirely as a result of
all the work, even to her relatives and friends.
