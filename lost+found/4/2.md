## This definitely goes somewhere, now that we have Humpty Dumpty Model Theory

 > Steve Kleene: and there must have been discussions between Church and Gödel, and I don't know how ready Gödel was to embrace the thesis that this was all effectively calculable functions but Church of course is the one that certainly came out explicitly with this.

> Steve Kleene: Then Gödel arrived in the Fall or Spring of the year 1933-34. Gödel was giving his lectures. Gödel had this notion of General Recursive Functions, and the question came up, y'know, well, does this embrace all effectively calculable functions and is it equivalent to lambda definability.

> Steve Kleene: I left Princeton in June of 1935, and of course we already had Church's Thesis in, it must have been the late spring of '34. That's when Gödel was talking about his General Recursive Functions.

> Steve Kleene: You don't happen to have a copy of Introduction to Metamathematics do you?

> Steve Kleene: Well, what Herbrand did in General Recursive Functions as presented by Gödel giving credit for ideas of Herbrand, is something I understand more than what Herbrand published. It was a little note of Herbrand's or a little, y'know, it was something short but whether it was a short note or just a short piece on the end of something else.

> Some Famous Logician: I knew it for a week or two when I had to take my exams. But I must say a few have slipped my mind.

> Steve Kleene: It helps to have written it.

> C. C. Chang: I don't even remember what's in _Model Theory_ anymore.

1: What?

0: A part of the foundations of mathematics.

1: WHAT?
