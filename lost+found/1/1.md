0: Right. Ok, let's start at the beginning.

1: Listening.

0: _(ahem)_

_(Narrator: 0 clears 0's throat.)_

0: Once upon a time, in the late 1800s, a guy named George segfaulted mathematics.

1: Segfaulted mathematics?!

0: Ok well not quite. More like he got root on the universe.

1: _Got ROOT on the UNIVERSE?!_

0: Ok that's not quite right either. His name was Georg Cantor.

> _I don't know what predominates in Cantor's theory, philosophy or theology, but I am sure there is no mathematics there._
> -Leopold Kronecker

1: Was he the first Foundational Person?

0: No no, he's not one of ours. Not to exclude him. He could have used a good hug and some proper friends, and I would have loved to know the guy. But in his heart, Cantor was a mathematician. He thought like a mathematician, and he wanted to be accepted by the mathematicians.

1: Why wasn't he accepted?

0: Well, he made the mistake of doing some mathematics.

1: What's wrong with that?

0: Well this mathematics was different. Or more accurately, it was the same. See what Cantor did was to use standard mathematical reasoning, the kind that was generally accepted by the mathematical community, to show that if you accept the standard types of definitions and proofs that are common in mathematics, then you're basically forced to accept that infinitely many different sizes of infinity "exist." There's a whole hierarchy of infinite "numbers" up above the normal numbers like $0, 1, ...$ etc. And if you believe in the familiar set of positive whole numbers, like if you agree that whole set is "a thing that exists," then it's pretty much impossible within normal mathematical reasoning to avoid being forced to admit that all the rest of these infinite numbers upstairs exist too.

1: Is that bad?

0: Well some people loved it. Like this guy who's quoted saying the following line in every book about this stuff.

0: Cantor himself wasn't sure the idea was even worth publishing, and sme mathematicians didn't think the questions he was addressing were interesting at all.

> _We can follow the ruminations of the 28-year-old Cantor in letters written in 1873 to Richard Dedekind, a young mathematician Cantor had met quite by chance the previous year while on vacation in Switzerland. Cantor, who had recently been promoted to a professorship at Halle, wrote showing Dedekind that (as we have already seen), one can construct a one-to-one matching between the natural numbers and the more inclusive set of all positive fractions. He even showed that the same is true for the set of all algebraic numbers. In his letter, Cantor raised the question of the possibility of a one-to-one matching between the set of natural numbers and the set of all real numbers. Dedekind’s reply suggested that he believed the question to be of little interest._
> 
> _About a week later, in another letter, Cantor was able to prove to Dedekind the remarkable fact that the set of real numbers cannot be matched with the set of natural numbers in a one-to-one manner, that infinite sets come in at least two sizes._
>
> _Apparently, Cantor himself wasn’t even sure that this finding was worth publishing. He only submitted it for publication after his former teacher Karl Weierstrass encouraged him to do so. The revolutionary implications of what Cantor had done were hardly evident in the four-page paper. The emphasis of the paper was not on the fact that infinite sets had been shown to come in more than one size, but rather that as a corollary, Cantor had obtained a new proof that there exist real numbers that are transcendental._

0: Still other people thought Georg was corrupting the youth.

1: C'mon, nobody would actually think infinity is "not suitable for kids."

0: I'm serious. Here's an example.

> _Kronecker, who headed mathematics at Berlin until his death in 1891, became increasingly uncomfortable with the prospect of having Cantor as a colleague, perceiving him as a "corrupter of youth" for teaching his ideas to a younger generation of mathematicians._

1: That's a bit of an over-reaction don't you think?

0: Not at all. Georg was totally corrupting the youth.

1: That's ridiculous. How are infinite numbers corrupting the youth?

0: I'll explain, follow me.
