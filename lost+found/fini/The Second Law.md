## The Enigma

> Steve Kleene: Well as I say, I don't know how firmly convinced Gödel was that his General Recursive Functions represented all effectively calculable functions.

> Gerald Sacks: He seemed very skeptical.

> Steve Kleene: I think he was skeptical. And it may well be that Turing's presentation was what brought Gödel around.

0: So Church comes up with Lambda Calculus. Gödel comes up with General Recursive Functions. Kleene proves the two systems are equivalent. And legend has it that when Gödel realized his system was equivalent to Church's Gödel says "Oh. Well then I guess mine was wrong."

1: Did that actually happen?

0: Not sure, but it's a good legend.

1: So how does Turing fit in to this?

0: Well Turing's work is what convinced Gödel.

1: Convinced him of what?

0: That the three of them had probably captured _all_ of computation in these definitions. 

1: Damn, what year was this?

0: 1936.

1: That's insane.

> Steve Kleene: We had done all this work before we heard of Turing. Turing's paper is also 1936. But a little later in 1936. But my impression is that Turing did it independently of knowing anything about what we were doing.

0: Yeah so Turing is over in England. Born in 1912 in the Paddington part of London where that famous bear is from. By this point he's 24 years old. Still an undergraduate. He's not aware of any of this work from Church, he may have known about Gödel. And he comes out with this paper as a 24 year old college kid that ends up convincing Gödel.

## TODO

TODO: Fill in the middle of this story.

TODO: Explain Turing machines and how they work.

TODO: Explain how this story ties in with Church and Godel.

When that's done, end with something like this...

## The Martyr

0: Turing finished the proof of the three-way equivalence, thus establishing more clearly than anyone else the plausibility of Church's Thesis. These unusual heroes seemed to have actually captured the concept of computation. Not within some particular formal system, but any computation that could ever be performed by any physical system. Over 100 years later, we still haven't found a single counterexample. I consider this story to be one of the greatest foundational achievements in history.

0: In a more sane universe, Turing's sex life would've been no more than a footnote to his story. No more significant than a randomly chosen footnote in one of his papers.

![[turing-1937-sex-footnote-2.png]]

1: What's that?

0: A footnote in one of his papers that happens to say $S(e(x))$.

1: Is this supposed to be important?

0: No. That's exactly the point. But in Turing's story, what should have been an unimportant footnote that happened to say $S(e(x))$ turned out to lead to the tragic and premature end of his story.

1: THAT footnote led to---

0: Not that one. I don't think anyone even noticed that one. Not sure Turing noticed either, though I like to think he did. This next bit is the sad one. The one people noticed.

1: What does it say? I can't quite read it.

0: Something like this.

> I don’t think I really do know much about jobs, except the one I had during the war, and that certainly did not involve any travelling. I think they do take on conscripts. It certainly involved a good deal of hard thinking, but whether you’d be interested I don’t know. Philip Hall was in the same racket and on the whole, I should say, he didn’t care for it. However I am not at present in a state in which I am able to concentrate well, for reasons explained in the next paragraph.

I shall shortly be pleading guilty to a charge of sexual offences with a young man. The story of how it all came to be found out is a long and fascinating one, which I shall have to make into a short story one day, but haven’t the time to tell you now. No doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man, but quite who I’ve not found out.

TODO: Finish this bit off and pop the stack back to Godel, and wrap up that story.
