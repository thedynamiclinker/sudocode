## The Enigma

> Steve Kleene: Well as I say, I don't know how firmly convinced Gödel was that his General Recursive Functions represented all effectively calculable functions.

> Gerald Sacks: He seemed very skeptical.
>
> Steve Kleene: I think he was skeptical. And it may well be that Turing's presentation was what brought Gödel around.

0: So Church comes up with Lambda Calculus. Gödel comes up with General Recursive Functions. Kleene proves the two systems are equivalent. And legend has it that when Gödel realized his system was equivalent to Church's Gödel says "Oh. Well then I guess mine was wrong."

1: Did that actually happen?

0: Not sure, but it's a good legend.

1: So how does Turing fit in to this?

0: Well Turing's work is what convinced Gödel.

1: Convinced him of what?

0: That the three of them had probably captured _all_ of computation in these definitions. 

1: Damn, what year was this?

0: 1936.

1: That's insane.

> Steve Kleene: We had done all this work before we heard of Turing. Turing's paper is also 1936. But a little later in 1936. But my impression is that Turing did it independently of knowing anything about what we were doing.

0: Yeah so Turing is over in England. Born in 1912 in the Paddington part of London where that famous bear is from. By this point he's 24 years old. Still an undergraduate. He's not aware of any of this work from Church, he may have known about Gödel. And he comes out with this paper as a 24 year old college kid that ends up convincing Gödel.

## TODO

TODO: Fill in the middle of this story.

TODO: Explain Turing machines and how they work.

TODO: Explain how this story ties in with Church and Gödel.

When that's done, end with something like this...

## The Martyr

0: Turing finished the proof of the three-way equivalence, thus establishing more clearly than anyone else the plausibility of Church's Thesis, now called Church-Turing. This was the final nail in the coffin. These three giants, the first three developers in the history of computing who together made the first language, the first compiler, and the first hardware design, these same these people now also seemed to have captured the concept of computation itself, in three definitions that none of them expected to be the same. Except maybe Turing. They captured the essence of computation, not within some particular formal system or machine, but any computation that could ever be performed by any physical system past or future. They got it. The final nail was this 1937 paper down below. Almost 100 years later, after all the developments in computing and technology since the late 1930s, our species still hasn;t found a single counterexample to Church and Turing's claim. Computation has a ceiling. That ceiling is universal. And it's damn easy to get there. Everything else is lots and lots of details that take place at or below the ceiling. I can't think of a more important achievement in the foundations of human knowledge in all of human history than that. The story of computation and how our species captured it is as important as the discovery of fire. I think even the discovery of electricity or magnetism or the strong and weak nuclear forces aren't as incredible as the discovery of computation. Despite all the well-deserved books about Gödel and Turing, this story is never told with anything close to the energy it deserves. And I can feel in my bones every way that the version of it I've told here is still an absolute failure compared to what this story deserves. It would take a new curriculum to really tell it properly. Students in our field, and even the profess{or, ional developer}s of our field don't know enough about the beginning or the middle of this story. Sadly most of us know about the end.

1: What was the end?

0: Not the end of the story. But an end to this thread.

![[turing-1937-sex-footnote-1.png]]

0: In any sane universe, Turing's sex life would've been no more than a footnote to his story. No more significant than a randomly chosen footnote in one of his papers.

![[turing-1937-sex-footnote-2.png]]

1: What's that?

0: A footnote in one of his papers that happens to say $S(e(x))$.

1: Is this supposed to be important?

0: No. That's the point. In Turing's story, what should have been an unimportant footnote that happened to say $S(e(x))$ turned out to lead to the premature end of his story.

1: THAT footnote led to---

0: No not that one. I don't think anyone even noticed that one. Not sure Turing noticed either, though I like to think he did. This next bit is the sad one. The one people noticed.

1: What does it say? I can't quite read it.

0: Something like this.

> I don’t think I really do know much about jobs, except the one I had during the war, and that certainly did not involve any travelling. I think they do take on conscripts. It certainly involved a good deal of hard thinking, but whether you’d be interested I don’t know. Philip Hall was in the same racket and on the whole, I should say, he didn’t care for it. However I am not at present in a state in which I am able to concentrate well, for reasons explained in the next paragraph.

I shall shortly be pleading guilty to a charge of sexual offences with a young man. The story of how it all came to be found out is a long and fascinating one, which I shall have to make into a short story one day, but haven’t the time to tell you now. No doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man, but quite who I’ve not found out.
