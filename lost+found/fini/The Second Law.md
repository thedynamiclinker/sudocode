## The Martyr

> Steve Kleene: Well as I say, I don't know how firmly convinced Gödel was that his General Recursive Functions represented all effectively calculable functions.

> Gerald Sacks: He seemed very skeptical.

> Steve Kleene: I think he was skeptical. And it may well be that Turing's presentation was what brought Gödel around.

0: So Church comes up with Lambda Calculus. Gödel comes up with General Recursive Functions. Kleene proves the two systems are equivalent. And legend has it that when Gödel realized his system was equivalent to Church's Gödel says "Oh. Well then I guess mine was wrong."

1: Did that actually happen?

0: Not sure, but it's a good legend.

1: So how does Turing fit in to this?

0: Well Turing's work is what convinced Gödel.

1: Convinced him of what?

0: That the three of them had probably captured _all_ of computation in these definitions. 

1: Damn, what year was this?

0: 1936.

1: That's insane.

> Steve Kleene: We had done all this work before we heard of Turing. Turing's paper is also 1936. But a little later in 1936. But my impression is that Turing did it independently of knowing anything about what we were doing.

0: Yeah so Turing is over in England. Born in 1912 in the Paddington part of London where that famous bear is from. By this point he's 24 years old. Still an undergraduate. He's not aware of any of this work from Church, he may have known about Gödel. And he comes out with this paper as a 24 year old college kid that ends up convincing Gödel.
