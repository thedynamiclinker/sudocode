TODO: Finish lambda calculus here.

TODO: Make it a dialogue in "The Little LISPer" style where we cover the technical details.

TODO: We should probably re-write the We file in a way that lets us pop the stack 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 so that the final file before `/etc/group` is "In the Beginning." This can wait until we have skeletons of the Church, Godel, and Turing stories basically complete.

TODO: The end of the Turing story (the letter to Norman Routledge) can be moved into `fini/Names` or `fini/In the Beginning`.

TODO: That way:
- The `init` file for each character is a short biographical introduction.
- The `fini` file for each character is the technical explanation of their definition of computation.
- Kleene is the glue that shows up throughout all of the biographical content _and_ technical content to glue things together, as promised, first with the Reminiscences of Logicians dialogues in the biographical sections, then with sections from _Introduction to Metamathematics_ in the technical sections.

TODO: The link below should eventually be to `fini/Names`, but we need to refactor `init/Names` and `init/In the Beginning` first.
