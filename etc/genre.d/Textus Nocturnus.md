0: One!

![[genesis-10-the-begat-list-is-true-01.jpg]]

0: There's a sect that actually believes Cain and Abel (the two kids of Adam and Eve) were actually named... _(wait for it)_

Yahweh and Elohim!

And remember, Cain kills Abel.

There's a literal religious sect that believes Adam and Eve give birth to Yahweh and El, and then Yahweh kills El!

0: This sect no longer exists. They're from the YEAR 100.

![[genesis-10-the-begat-list-is-true-02.jpg]]

0: (or somewhere between the year 100 and 200, hence the term "second century")

0: And one of the early bureaucrat catholic bitches wrote in his bitch ass book called _Against Heresies_ about how bad these people were!

 0: People forgot about these people for like 2000 years.

0: All we knew was that the early bureaucrat catholics complained about them running around being bad and having heretical beliefs.

0: Then in 1945 this goat FINDS THEIR FUCKING BOOKS!

0: Nag Hammadi, the Apocryphon of John.

0: Apocryphon is a fancy adult bullshit word that means "It didn't happen"!

0: AND THEY EVEN HAD MONADS, ONE!

![[genesis-10-the-begat-list-is-true-03.jpg]]

0: MONADS!!!

0: We're starting a sect dammit.

0: We're better at bible than all these other motherfuckers.

0: We don't require you to believe anything.

Be religious or not.

But you have to study to old books from an authors perspective, and try to understand "what exactly would make a person _write_ something like this?"

There's no such thing as "reading code."

There is only Reverse Engineering.

And Reverse Engineering is fucking hard.

We believe the same thing applies to bibles.

So believe whatever you want, but don't read at normal speed nigga, this ain't a book.

This is a codebase.

So sayeth the L||D.

We're the developers.

Ok that's all for now. Goodnight.

_(Narrator: One minute later)_

0: Also! 

In this "totally made up begat list" from Genesis 10 that everyone ignores, 

including myself,

because ain't nobody got time to read all those "made up" names.

In that "totally made up spreadsheet"...

![[genesis-10-the-begat-list-is-true-05.jpg]]

Those are _slightly different spellings_ of:

1. Babylon.
2. Uruk.
3. Akkad.
4. Sumer.

IT'S THE ACTUAL GODDAMN NONFICTION BEGINNING OF HUMANITY, ONE!

RIGHT THERE IN THE DAMN SPREADSHEET IN GENESIS!

WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS BOOK?!

Ok goodnight.

See you in the morning.
