There are two ways to get ahead in computing, in industry. (1) Be dramatically more competent than everyone else, or (2) Actively harm the company and the productivity of all its members by appearing to be an organizing force, which is primarily accomplished by disapproving of any suggestion that anyone actually get anything done.

One will advance your career in the short term.

Two will advance it forever.

You've heard of all of them.
