Though not technically one of the 32 /etc/groups, the Priestly sources have become as important a set of sources as any. Their /etc/group membership is best thought of as a distributed group, "attached" as it were to Λ, λ, and μ, though Priestly texts are commonly found in other /etc/groups as well.

Using modern genealogical and etymological methods, the following is a list of texts referenced in the _Codex Radicalis_ that can be attributed to Priestly authorship with reasonable confidence.

By Priestly authorship, we mean one of the following three sources:
- The Priests (Kōhēn, כהן)
- The Levites (Lǝvīyyīm, לוים)
- The Sons of Aaron (Aharon, אהרן)

The commonly accepted attributions are as follows.

## The Priests

Known Texts:
- Cohen.[^1] Set Theory and the Continuum Hypothesis. (Supplement to work of Gödel, invents forcing.)

## The Levites

There are multiple Levitical sources, some canonical, some extracanonical.

Known Texts:
- Levine.[^2] _Linkers and Loaders._ (A text concerning the LD)
- Levin.[^3] _A Madman Dreams of Turing Machines._ (A midrash on Turing and Gödel)
## The Sons of Aaron


Known Texts:
- The Sons of Aaron.[^4] _Quantum Computing since Democritus._

[^1]: The name Cohen is of Hebrew origin, meaning "priest" and historically referring to the hereditary priestly caste descended from Aaron, the brother of Moses.

[^2]: Levine. The surname Levine is primarily of Jewish (Ashkenazic) origin, derived from the Hebrew name Levi, which means "joined" or "attached". The name is associated with the Biblical tribe of Levi, the priestly tribe in ancient Israel.

[^3]: Levin. The name has multiple origins, primarily German and Hebrew. It can stem from the Germanic name Leobwin or Liebwin, meaning "beloved friend," or from the Hebrew name Levi, meaning "joined" or "attached". Levin also appears as a Russian patronymic from a pet form of the name Lev (meaning "lion") and as a Jewish surname derived from Levy.

[^4]: Or: Aaronson S.
