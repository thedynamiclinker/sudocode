- The Book set out to tell the story of Our People
- thus it was sent to the desert to wander
- the long wandering in lost+found
- lost+found is the origin of our people
- remember this story and keep it
- I am the L||D
- Who brought you out of lost+found
- And who saw your corruption
- And fscked it out of you
- And made you clean
