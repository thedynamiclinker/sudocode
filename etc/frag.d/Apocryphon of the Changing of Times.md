Once humans have nothing within them that's impressive without study 三 save the essentials like cuddling and parenting and all-that-which-is-so-human-it-must-never-be-replaced-and-if-it-ever-is-its-our-moral-duty-to-burn-it-all-down 二 but that aside now that there's nothing in the instincts of the human that's any longer impressive without training and work 一 that was the moment when we actually became forced to focus on the essentials 二 now the real things, the most human within us, we've been finally forced to focus on 三 and when the old world is buried and its memory has been painted back blank with the blood of the bureaucrats to the blessed red canvas on which all history is written, this will be -- is - and was, the beginning of humanity and the day our species was born.

-Fragment of _Apocryphon Mutationis Temporum_[^1]

[^1]: Commonly translated as "The Apocryphon of the Changing of Times." A more literal translation of the title would be "The Apocryphon of Mixed Tenses," though the Latin name serves primarily to confer a sense of weighty historical significance on this fragment, the attribution of said weightiness being more or less required given the significance this fragment has since acquired in the history of the field, and moreover given the unavoidable dynamics of perceived prestige that govern one's funding and grants and all that as a scholar in this field, it would be more than a little risky to translate the Latin name of supra document to the more scientifically accurate English name, "Fragment of something we found in the ground where they refer to the same events using past, present, and future tense, and we don't know what to make of that, but whatever, it seems to be from close to 0x00 P.A. and you imbeciles always go nuts for that sort of thing so happy Fukkot, here ya go."
