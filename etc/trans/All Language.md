## On Translation

> _I am a cage, in search of a bird._

> _I cannot make you understand. I cannot make anyone understand what is happening inside me. I cannot even explain it to myself._

> _Don't bend; don't water it down; don't try to make it logical; don't edit your own soul according to the fashion. Rather, follow your most intense obsessions mercilessly._
>
> -An author of (primarily) erotic vampire stories, writing the introduction to a book by an Author (caps for emphasis) who the above quote is more commonly attributed to, because let's be honest, quoting an author best known for vampire porn makes one feel a bit self-conscious, in one's soul, at least the socially conscious parts of it, and but so it's not surprising that the more common habit among those who quote the quote up there above is to bend it a bit, in accordance with the logical aim of making one's soul (the quoter's I mean) seem more dark, serious, sexy, violently passionate, like a beast of the night, veiled by darkness that can only be turned to light by you the Reader, by a love consummated by blood, in other words erotic like a vampire, but I digress.
