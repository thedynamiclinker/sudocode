The documents collectively known as Sudocode were the end product of a long process of compilation and assembly taking place over many years, culminating in the work of the individual referred to in the scholarly jargon as "L", the letter standing variously for "Linker," "Loader," "Link Loader," "Link Editor," "Source of Links," "Creator of Links," "συνέρχομαι τοῦ ἀββᾶ,"[^1] "Pater Nexus," "Father of Links," "Abraham of Linking," or "Abraham Linkin'."[^2]

Despite the unfamiliar terminology, this individual was essentially an Editor.

The resulting unified document produced by the Linker is what we now call Sudocode.

The earliest extant version of the unified text is known in scholarly circles as the Codex Radicalis.

Discuss Le Soixante-Neuf and MLK's Version.

Other well known versions include The Privileged Version, The Version of Privilege, The Checked Privilege Version, The Version of Escalated Privilege, The Democratic People's Version of Checked Privilege, The National Social Version of Privileged Escalation, The Democratic People's Republican Checked Privilege Version, Young's Literal Translation, and Czech Republic's Stopařův[^4] Guide i Manuál Vrjns[^5] em Mladý s Holý[^6] of Pravda Lež.[^3]


[^1]: Sic. Likely a transcription error of ἀββᾶ τοῦ συνέρχομαι, "father of unification, linkage, or coming together," which fits much better in the surrounding context than does the Greek expression above, which translates to a significantly less dignified and rather embarrassing expression whose denotations and connotations, taken together, read as something rather more like "come to daddy."

[^2]: Citation needed.

[^3]: Subtitle: "Do panic." Meaning unknown.

[^4]: The genitive inflection of the agentive nominative form of the verb "to hitchhike," in Czech.
