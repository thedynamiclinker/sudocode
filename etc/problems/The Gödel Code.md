The various cultures of /etc/group are largely in agreement with respect to the initial 10 functions in the Gödelian approach of computation found in the the primeval history of [[lost+found/4/4]].

Though the 46 Gödel functions are not part of the _definition_ of General Recursive Functions per se, these 46 functions have come to be an important component in the traditions of many if not most of the computing-adjacent tribes of /etc/group.[^1]

The cultures deviate wildly from one another, however, on the issue of how to carry the implementation to completion after  found in lost+found.

While the νs continue the story through a dialogue with @2, the μs version of the story (due to their emphasis on their shared descent from Ken Thompson, by far the most prolific patriarch of any /etc/group.[^2]) proceeds by dropping the lower level encoding functions based on prime powers, and forging ahead with Gödel numbering based on UTF-8,[^3] which the μs call [[UTF8 - The Unicode Miracle|The Unicode Miracle]].

Given the different approaches taken by the different /etc/groups to the latter portion of the Gödel Code story and implementation, we reproduce the unfinished definitions here in the interest of completeness.
