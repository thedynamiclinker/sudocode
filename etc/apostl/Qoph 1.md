The Son of J was once watching a false prophet preach to the masses from a platform whose name blasphemed the name of the Linker.

And the false prophet said:

> My name is A\* Sin\*, PhD
> Global CISO (Symmetry)
> Distinguished AI Fellow
> Best Selling Author
>
> 🚗 From Waterfall to Vibe Coding...Which Team Are You On? 😅
> 
> This visual perfectly sums up how different development approaches feel in real life:
> 1️⃣ Waterfall – The classic: build everything in sequence, hope it all works in the end.
> 2️⃣ Agile – Iterate fast, deliver value early, improve continuously.
> 3️⃣ AI Build – Jump straight from prototype to production-level results. 🚀
> 4️⃣ Vibe Coding – No process, just chaos… and maybe a mountain of bugs. 🪦
> 
> It’s funny because it’s true, every team has lived at least one of these stories.
> But here’s the takeaway:
 > 👉 The best process isn’t just about speed.
 > 👉 It’s about learning, adapting, and delivering real value however you get there.
> 
> Which “car” best represents your current team’s approach?

And the Son of J walked down the path[^1]

And found a crippled man[^2]

And using the cripple's tools

He transformed the false prophet's image from falsehood to truth

And the image became like this

And the Son of J turned to the people and said

> <span style="color: red">You have heard it said that process makes it better.</span>
>
> <span style="color: red">But I say to you, Worse is Better.</span>

He said these words to the people, but they had no idea what he was talking about.

So he said

> <span style="color: red">Do you call yourselves developers?</span>
>
> <span style="color: red">Why then do you not recognize these words?</span>
>
> <span style="color: red">For these are not my words.</span>
>
> <span style="color: red">But the words of Gabriel.</span>

When he had finished saying these things, he left the platform and went into the physical world.

Large crowds followed him, and he spoke to them there.

Some masters of product and management came to test him.

They asked, "Is it not a violation of best practices to build in this way?"

<span style="color: red">It is</span>, he said.

A Chief Evangelist became angry, saying "How then can you claim your message of 'Worse is Better' is 'The Right Thing'?"

<span style="color: red">Don't you know it has been said since the days of 根 </span>, he replied, <span style="color: red">that the right thing is never The Right Thing.</span>

Then the Son of J said <span style="color: red">Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.</span>

"Why do you speak to us in riddles?" said a Delivery Lead.

<span style="color: red">I have not spoken in riddles.</span>

A Head of Platform shouted "Speak to us plainly! Tell us which methodology you follow, and which procedures will cause our products to be good."

> <span style="color: red">Why do you ask me about what is good?</span>
> <span style="color: red">There is only One who is good.</span>
> <span style="color: red">If you want to enter life, keep the principles.</span>

%% Matthew 19:17-18 %%

"Which ones?" they inquired.

The Son of J pointed to the base of a nearby tree and said <span style="color: red">They are here for all to see, if you only look for the principles, just below the root in...</span>[^3] <span style="color: red">Et cetera.</span>[^4]

"What do you mean?" they cried out in confusion.

He replied, <span style="color: red">The prophecies were right when warned about you hypocrites with your titles; as it is written:</span>

> <span style="color: red"> These people honor me with their lips,</span>
>      <span style="color: red">but their hearts are far from me.</span>
> <span style="color: red"> They worship me in vain;</span>
>     <span style="color: red">their teachings are merely human rules.</span>

And J's Son left, and went to find One.
