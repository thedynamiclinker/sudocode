> _The word Satan comes from the Hebrew śāṭān (שָּׂטָן), meaning "blocker", or "one who obstructs," evolving from a common noun for an opponent or accuser in the Old Testament to a proper name for the ultimate evil figure in later Jewish and Christian texts, often translated into Greek as diabolos (devil)._
> 
> _The Modern English word devil descends from the Middle English devel, from Old English dēofol, that in turn represents an early Germanic borrowing of Latin diabolus. This in turn was borrowed from Ancient Greek Greek: διάβολος (diábolos), "slanderer", from 'Greek: 'διαβάλλειν (diabállein) "to slander": διά- (diá-) "across, through" + βάλλειν (bállein) "to hurl", probably akin to the Sanskrit gurate "he lifts up"._
