ΧΡ. (abbrev)
1. (also Χρ). The Chi Rho (☧, English pronunciation /ˈkaɪ ˈroʊ/ KY-roh; also known as chrismon) is one of the earliest forms of the Christogram, formed by superimposing the first two (capital) letters一chi and rho (ΧΡ)一of the Greek ΧΡΙΣΤΟΣ (rom: Christos) in such a way that the vertical stroke of the rho intersects the center of the chi.
