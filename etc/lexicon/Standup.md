Standup.[^1] (noun).

A daily ritual common in pre-LD developmer culture circa 0x00 P.A.

The standup was typically carried out in the morning, in a public space within the off-rink[^2] areas of the company, with the companions standing in a circle facing one another.

The ritual involved a public affirmation, by each of the companions in a company[^3], of one's daily goals and how they would serve the collective goals of the company.

Though the function of the ritual is primarily believed to be the reaffirmation of one's social obligations to one's companions, there are clear religious undertones as well.

Most notable of these was the almost universal refrain with which each companion ended their affirmation, a statement which translates roughly as "\[There is\] No Satan."[^4]
