---

When Aruru heard this,
She wet her hands,
She pinched off clay,
She cast it down upon the steppe,
She created valiant Enkidu in the steppe,
...
He knew neither people nor inhabited land,
He dressed as animals do.
He ate grass with gazelles,
With beasts he jostled at the water hole,
With wildlife he drank his fill of water.

(Later)

Gilgamesh said to him, to the hunter:
Go, hunter, take with you Shamhat the harlot,
When the wild beasts draw near the water hole,
Let her strip off her clothing, laying bare her charms.
When he sees her, he will approach her.
His beasts that grew up with him on the steppe will deny him.

(Later)

Shamhat loosened her garments,
She opened her loins, he took her charms.
She was not bashful, she took his vitality.
She tossed aside her clothing and he lay upon her,
She treated him, a human, to woman’s work,
As in his ardor he caressed her.
Six days, seven nights was Enkidu aroused, flowing into Shamhat.

After he had his fill of her delights,
He set off toward his beasts.
When they saw him, Enkidu, the gazelles shied off,
The wild beasts of the steppe shunned his person,
Enkidu had polluted his virginal body.
His knees stood still, while his beasts were going away,
Enkidu was too slow, he could not run as before,
But he had gained reason, broadened his understanding.

He returned, he sat at the harlot’s feet,
The harlot was looking into his face,
While he listened to what the harlot was saying.
The harlot said to him, to Enkidu:

You are handsome, Enkidu, you are become like a god,
Why roam the steppe with wild beasts?
Come, let me lead you to ramparted Uruk,
To the hallowed temple, abode of Anu and Ishtar,
The place of Gilgamesh, who is perfect in strength,
And so, like a wild bull, he lords it over the young men
