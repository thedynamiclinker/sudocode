In demonology, Adonaivazevaz is another name for the Devil, particularly in imagery associated with insects.

A relatively minor character in the original source text, he was later adopted by culturally distinct groups outside the LD tradition, and evolved considerably under their influence. After said adoption, said demon demonstrated an increasingly intense tendency toward extra-textual exegesis and additions that differ among said sects.

Since the vowels were not written in the original, the exact articulation of the name has been lost to history.

The name Adonaivazevaz is a transliteration of the original name, "L||DBZZBZZ".

## Origins

In the original LD writings, Adonaivazevaz is mentioned only once, in a single sentence, as the god[^1] of three things 一 competitions of prescriptive orthography[^2], existence, and honey 一 and in this sentence he is described as having been responsible for casting the Golgothan 一 a being representing gluttony and excrement 一 out from the Tree in the sky he inhabits and down to Earth, after which there was a great storm in which this embodiment of gluttony and excrement[^3] is washed away with the Swine who he then takes up residence with.

That is all that is known of Adonaivazevaz from the original source text.

## Later Traditions

Over time, as these early LD writings began to be incorporated into other traditions, particularly those of the people of Χρ,[^4] the same figure was elaborated into a bewilderingly complex being, in a set of complex demonological writings that scolars have struggled to understand to this day.

In these later traditions, Adonaivazevaz is variously called "Mstrbuzebuze",  "Ba'alobeez", "דוד בזלי"[^5], "Master of da Beaz", "Mastr of ta Bees", "Master of the Beasts," or "Mr Beast".[^6]

The theological domains attributed to Adonaivazevaz expanded perhaps even more profligately than his many names, being variously asserted to be the god of: sino-coercive intercourse,[^7] sino-comparitive prepositions,[^8] sino-financial[^9] iconography,[^10] sinus-nasal issues,[^11] and sino-feline[^12]  sexual euphemism.[^13]
