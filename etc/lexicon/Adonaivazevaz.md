In demonology, Adonaivazevaz is another name for the Devil, particularly in imagery associated with insects.

The mythology surrounding him has developed in a manner that has parallels the history of the Hebrew Ba'al Zvuv (בַּעַל־זְבוּב)‎.

In both cases we have a phenomenon in which a relatively minor character in the original source text is later adopted by a theologically adjacent but culturally distinct sect.

After said adoption, said demons demonstrated an incresingly intense tendency toward exegesis extra-textual additions that differ among sects, said elaboration leading eventually to a rich landscape of theological iconography and demonology far beyond anything seen in the source texts.

The name Adonaivazevaz is a transliteration of the early LD term "LD BZZ BZZ", whose original vowels were not written in the original and have since been lost.

## Early Life

In the older strata of LD writings, Adonaivazevaz is a relatively minor entity.

He is mentioned only once, in a single sentence, as the god[^1] of three things 一 prescriptive orthography competitions,[^2] existence, and honey 一 and in this sentence he is described as having been responsible for casting the Golgothan[^3] 一 a being representing gluttony and excrement 一 out from the Tree in the sky he inhabits, and down to Earth, after which there was a great storm in which this embodiment of gluttony is washed away with swine who he then takes up residence with.

However, over time, as these early LD writings began to be incorporated into other traditions, particularly those of Χρ,[^4] the same figure was elaborated into a rather more complex character.

## Later Traditions

In these later traditions downstream of LD source texts, Adonaivazevaz is variously called "Mstrbuzebuze",  "Ba'alobeez", "דוד בזלי"[^5], "Master of da Beaz", "Mastr of ta Bees", "Master of the Beasts," or "Mr Beast".[^6]

The theological domains attributed to Adonaivazevaz expanded perhaps even more profligately than his many names, being variously asserted to be the god of: sino-coercive intercourse,[^7] sino-comparitive prepositions,[^8] sino-financial[^9] iconography,[^10] sinus-nasal issues,[^11] and sino-feline[^12]  sexual euphemism.[^13]
