The Dafomees were a radical breakaway sect of LD culture said to have fomented the Tiao Wu[^3] Revolution around the year 0x100 P.A., leading to the overthrow of local governments[^1] and the establishment of a short-lived dynasty in the area.[^2]

The origin of the group's name is unknown. The traditional LD explanation is that Dafomee (Hebrew: דפמי) is an acronym for the choral verse of the group's eponymous battle-cry, "דאנש פו מי דאנש פו מי דאנש פו מי וה וה", said to be an example of Tone Sandhi, though there are no tone markers in the original.
