Though much has been written in an attempt to uncover the identity of the unknown Authors of Sudocode, perhaps the most convincing theory to date concerns a woman named \[NAME-REDACTED\].

Though she never claimed publicly to be the Author of the text, there are many hints suggesting her involvement.

By age \[AGE-REDACTED\], \[NAME-REDACTED\] was the Chief Operating Officer of an \[INDUSTRY-REDACTED\] company named LD LLC.

Around this time, she entered the real estate market, purchasing her first house.

However, records indicate that she purchased it not as a primary residence, but as an investment property, and assigned legal ownership of the property to the same entity, LD.

Further, after the purchase of this house, she continued to rent, and live in, but not own, the same (much smaller) dwelling unit that she had lived in before the purchase of the (significantly larger) home.

There are no records of any products ever having been sold or even offered by LD.

It is widely believed that LD existed merely _Res tantum legalis_[^1] as a legal entity designed to provide "Limited Liability" for its members in case of legal action. Further, LD appears to have acted as a "pass-through" entity 一 one whose profits were not reinvested toward scaling the business, nor toward marketing, or advertising, or hiring employees, or in any other way that might benefit the business. Rather, its profits were merely "passed through," directly to the members, until the company's accounts contained no more assets than were required to cover basic operating costs.

According to a recent biography by \[NAME-REDACTED\]'s grandson,[^2] she lived at this time in a clandestine \[DEGENERACY-REDACTED\] marriage, one of which she rarely spoke publicly.

Though the marriage is said to have been long term, committed, and consistently happy, it was not strictly speaking a "marriage," as such unions were not legally recognized by the authorities of that era, and were considered taboo and morally unacceptable by the majority of peoples and cultures in those days, both in religious communities (from Judaism, to Catholicism, to Protestant Christianity), and (as much, if not more) in comparatively secular and progressive circles.

Her grandson's research[^3] into the laws of the time and place in which she lived demonstrate that -- for individuals in a relationship of this form -- even _attempting_ to marry one's partner could come with prohibitive fines or a lengthy prison sentence.[^4]

The question then arises of why an unassuming young woman would:
- at age \[AGE-REDACTED\]
- be not only COO of a company
- but begin purchasing houses, large ones
- using what appear to have been her own personal funds
- and then assigning legal ownership of these houses, not to herself, but to a company
- one that just happens to be named LD
- and doing so without being particularly wealthy or well-connected
- in an era when buying a home was considered financially impossible for all but the most well-off of her generation
- and doing so without being particularly wealthy or well-connected
- while in a "happy, committed, long-term relationship"
- of the sort that was punishable by 10 years in prison, if its existence was confirmed by the authorities of the time

Though \[NAME-REDACTED\] was known by her contemporaries to be a friendly, soft-spoken, and unimposing figure, her biography paints a radically different picture of what she was like behind the scenes.

She reads like a character out of history. For where 一 outside of history or fiction 一 does one find a person living their entire life "in character," playing the role of the obedient and well-behaved \[ETHNICITY-REDACTED\] girl, while at the same time living a secret life behind the scenes that places her alongside biblical matriarchs like Hagar, Rachel, and Bathsheba?

In this chapter, we outline what we believe to be the evidence that \[NAME-REDACTED\] was involved in the activities of the group that produced the document known as Sudocode. 

In fact, we believe she may have been the primary author, and to have modeled the character One (later known as 1) after he一

	> An individual commits an offense if: (1) s/he is legally married and s/he: (a) purports to marry or does marry a person other than his spouse in this state, or any other state or foreign country, under circumstances that would, but for the actor’s prior marriage, constitute a marriage; or (b) lives with a person other than his spouse in this state under the appearance of being married. A conviction for \[CRIME-REDACTED\] is punished by default as a Felony of the Third Degree, with a maximum possible fine under \[STATE-REDACTED\] state law of up to $10,000 and prison time of up to 10 years.]
