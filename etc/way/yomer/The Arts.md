What is Art?

Walk the Louvre and keep a list of all the different kinds you see.

I mean the different kinds of reasons you see
inside the people who made each bit.

Pretty quick if you're listening you
can see some things pretty
clear.

## 1

Some art's a cry of pain
a compulsive love and inability
to _not_ create the damn thing.
They're the ones who die young.
Not much of that in museums,
save the van Goghs.

Other art's a day job.
Naked angel babies feature prominently here,
as do all those busts of the triumphish enwigged Great Men©®™
who just so happen to have commissioned the damn thing.
Here you see the soul of the creator skilled and bored,
engaging in a sort of blue collar fine art then
and now viewed in quiet dimlit rooms
where viewers walk at the speed of
grocery store browsing, equally
bored, past works of skill that
don't shout much into the
future that one can hear
in the quiet rooms, b/c
this sort of art doesn't
contain all that much
love or pain, and it
probably can't,
for like, idk,
structural
reasons.

There's a kind of art too that's just practical.
Old pottery, ceramic bowls, everyday stuff.
And sure there's art _on_ the stuff,
And sure it counts as art,
Same as Pottery Barn,
but y'know, way old.
And at least that's
pretty cool
I guess.

Then there's this.

![[marble-sculpture-03.jpg]]

Look closely and ask
what part of the human soul
makes a person do this.

![[marble-sculpture-02.jpg]]

They're obsessed with veils, hair and rope,
the creators of this genre.

![[marble-sculpture-04.jpg]]

These are the developers.
The autists and nerds.
The highly technical.

There's a passion here that
somehow shares nothing
with van Gogh and that
best-ever-in-all-of-art
triangle slapped on
in the background
after he painted
the front.

These are our people,
and I can tell you a some
truths about them just as
confidently as I could if
they right were here
with me now:

They didn't really care
about ropes and veils
and hair.

They're showing off.
They're stunt hacking.
What can I get away with.
I'm gonna make this god
damn rock look like the
softest satin on god's
green earth, though
the Earth (they'd
correct us) isn't
primarily green
but rather blue
to 1st order as
the oceans are
a majority and
then to 2nd or\\
der its brown &
only green in
the higher or\\
der terms
above
that.

They're the autists.
They're the nerds.
And they're right.
The earth is blue.

At least to first order.

That's why they could draw this

32,000 years ago.

And this.

Why can't you?
