The use of the number seven in [[lost+found/5/1]] has generated some debate.

We outline the most plausible hypotheses here.

1. The Enigma machine, invented in 1918, uses seven alphabet substitutions via rotors to achieve seven alphabet substitutions between input and output letters. This is perhaps the most plausible interpretation.
2. The International Museum of World War II near Boston has seven Enigma machines on display. Scholars who date this document's Authorship to later periods have argued that this fact was misunderstood by the Authors to suggest that only seven Enigma machines still existed or ever existed.
3. There is a similar set of seven Enigma machines on display at the National Cryptologic Museum, an American museum of cryptologic history that is affiliated with the National Security Agency (NSA), pictured below.
4. Whatever [[Seven Seals|this]] is all about.[^1]

Ultimately, the reason for the choice of the number seven is unknown, and the issue mostly only discussed by the types of folks who have a screw or two loose internally, if you catch my drift.
