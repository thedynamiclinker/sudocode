The ⟂ docs.
- Pronounced "Orthodox." The Orthogonal Documents. Refers to theoretical computer science, primary computability and complexity (aka Π & Ο) as elaborated in the decades since the λs and the μs split. Though the orthodocs appear on the surface to be the same culture as the λs and μs, this group is almost exclusively found among the ivory iotas of academia, and is mostly orthogonal to the history of our people, hence the name. While one could argue that the λs are similarly native to academia, the λs have a long history of evangelism and of building things that is not found to the same extent among the Orthodocs, whose culture places a greater emphasis on tenure, the production of paper[^1], and other priestly concerns.

[^1]: Or "papers."
