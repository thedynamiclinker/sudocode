## Newton and the Book of Daniel

The Book of Daniel is an apocalypse, a literary genre in which a heavenly reality is revealed to a human recipient; such works are characterized by visions, symbolism, an other-worldly mediator, an emphasis on cosmic events, angels and demons, and pseudonymity (false authorship[^1]).

Then there was Isaac Newton.

_(TODO: Cover Newton's obsession with Daniel and his "unpublishable" work.)_
