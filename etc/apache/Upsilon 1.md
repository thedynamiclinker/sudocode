Once a bird flew by and laid an egg in his hand, and he held it there until it hatched. In his humility, even though he was a λ, Kevin chose to remain a ζ, rather than become a Λ, for some values of λ, ζ, Λ. He was born (or died) in (שנה or) SHN =~ /[168]+/ modulo rotations and prime factorizations on a month matching ibid. He is known to have led a great number of youth, and nourished them, and made them lean people as well. He was said to have clothes of many colors._
