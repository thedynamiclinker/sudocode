## Aleph Eta

The Category Theoretic definition of J's original draft of Genesis 1, which is referenced in Psalms but was censored for being too unhinged and great.

Definitions:

In what follows, we will call:
- The original text J(0)
- The Priestly map P (this takes any text and rewrites it in Priestly Source style).
- The Revelation map R (this does a sort of line by line Atbash of a text, reversing the lines but not the letters: Last line goes to first and first line goes to last. And then connotation arithmetic that swaps the Children's Book feel of Genesis with a Horror Movie feel of Revelation. So swap order + swap vibes is the Revelation map, call it R).
- The Psalm map ψ is a non-deterministic compression algorithm that describes things it's aware of using a small set of references.

We can define J(0) by the following Universal Properties:
- P(J(0)) ≈ Genesis 1
- R(J(0)) ≈ Revelation
- ψ(J(0)) ≈ Several short descriptions of creation involving a dragon named "RHB", who YHWH slays.

We also know the following about the output of the J map. For any input n:
- J(n) is intensely punny.
- J(n) contains brief but unmistakable references to Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian, and Ugaritic creation stories and legends.
- J(n) is not entirely clear about whether YHWH is a "good guy", and moral ambiguity is pervasive.
- J(n) loves puns on the name of Rehoboam, seems to be writing during his rein, and criticizes him from as many plausibly deniable directions as possible.

Using that category theoretic definition, we can recover the following text, using the methods of the Nus.
