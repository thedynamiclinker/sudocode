> _The Gospel of the Egyptians, also known as the Holy Book of the Great Invisible Spirit, can be a rather baffling work. It may be helpful to divide it into four parts. First, it begins with the generation of a bewildering array of deities who come into being as part of the heavenly bureaucracy, beginning with the Great Invisible Spirit, who emanates a trinity of Father, Mother and Son, each of whom in turn becomes differentiated into eight elements, and the pattern of eights continues later as well. Here the influence of Egyptian mythology is evident, as the ‘Octads’ or ‘Ogdoads’ in the Gospel of the Egyptians often consist of four male and female pairs. Similarly, the Egyptian cosmological text On the Primaeval Ocean, from the first half of the second century ce, refers to the gods and goddesses of ‘the Ogdoad according to their names … Here are their names: Amun, Amunet, Heh, Hauhet, Kek, Kauket, Nun and Naunet’..._

A secret invisible mystery came forth:

		  I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I
		 Ē Ē Ē Ē Ē Ē Ē Ē Ē Ē Ē Ē Ē Ē Ē Ē Ē Ē Ē Ē Ē Ē Ē Ē
		 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
		U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U
		   E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E
		 A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A
		Ō Ō Ō Ō Ō Ō Ō Ō Ō Ō Ō Ō Ō Ō Ō Ō Ō Ō Ō Ō Ō Ō Ō Ō Ō

This is how the three powers praised the Great Invisible Spirit,
unnameable, virginal, upon whom no one can call, and his female
-male virgin.
