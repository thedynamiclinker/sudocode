> _Don't document bad code, rewrite it_
> -Brian Kernighan, Elements of Programming Style

A unique feature of our field, not understood by outsiders, is that reading code is generally much harder than writing it. This surprising fact follows from three simple observations:

1. Writing is Engineering.
2. Reading is Reverse Engineering.
3. Reverse Engineering is harder than Engineering.

Brian Kernighan's timeless advice is a downstream consequence of this principle.
