The ultimate reason to avoid closed source software is this timeless truth that all the best developers understand.

Your code is not your IP or your product.

Code is a liability, not an asset.

The asset is what your code does.

There is zero business risk in open sourcing your code.

If your product is worth reverse engineering for economic reasons, we can do it.

We as developers are never "understanding-bound," collectively, as an entire field.

Your business has value. But your code is not that value. Let go, and watch your marketcap increase.

If you're afraid, just remember the story of "Dot Cloud."
