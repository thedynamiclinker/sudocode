When you think something is an industry standard, a best practice, or a good tool to use, there are three dimensions to consider, only two of which are commonly discussed.

1. Technical Index: Would it be good if you were the only user of it?
2. Social Index: Size of the community of developers, users, places to get support, etc.

In either of the above cases, more is obviously better, all else equal.

The third dimension is the missing denominator that should be used to decrease any estimate based on the first two. That is:

3. Marketing Index: Size of the global community of people who are trying to sell anything related to this tool.

Item 3 is a measure of the total amount of bullshit that's floating around in the global atmosphere about this tool.

For the linux kernel, it's low. For Red Hat though, it's a bit higher.

For databases, it's high, even though many databases are free.

For vector databases (at least as of the mid 2020s), it's even higher.

For cloud anything, it's off the charts.

To be fair, databases and cloud infrastructure are useful. But they're massively overused.

How can you get a rough estimate of how overused they are, and how much less often you need them than you may think?

Mentall divide by the size of the global marketing team.

You don't need the exact size.

Just guess.

You already know.
