TODO: Finally! The /etc/group dialogue!

This comes immediately after the `/dev/zero` story in `lost+found/We`, and this is where we first define "The Lambdas" and "The Mus."

This file frames the rest of the book by giving single character names to all the various cultures in mathematics and computing that will show up throughout the rest of the story.

"The Lambdas" and "The Mus" will be our focus, but in order to know who they are, we need to know who they're not.

In this file, we learn about all the other cultures and tribes in mathematics and computing, where The Lambdas and The Mus fit in to that world, and how they're similar and different from each other.
