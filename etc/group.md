This following is a comprehensive list of the various cultures in computing and mathematics that we'll encounter throughout the rest of the story, as we track how computing develops from 1937, where we left off, until the modern era of 20XY.

Though our story will follow The Lambdas and The Mus, in order to know how they (i.e. we) fit in to the broader world around us, it is important to gain a better understanding of that world.

So here is a brief summary of that world.

Longer descriptions of the other tribes will be provided as the need arises, in `/etc/apache`.

# The /etc/groups


## α: Algebra

> _Abstract Algebra PhD student, to her mentor: What do you picture when you picture a Group?_
> _Abstract Algebra Professor: A capital G._
>
> -Anonymous Algebraist

## β: Unassigned

It's not polite to call a group the betas.

## γ: Geometry
> _A point is that which has no part._
> _A line is breadthless length._
>
> -The Vintage Foundational Gammas.

Began with Euclid. Was considered foundations for roughly 2000 years. Now consists of differential geometry and all manner of tensors. Basically fancy calculus on shapes.

## δ: Calculus
This includes differential and integral calculus in one variable, multiple variables, or infinitely many variables in the so-called calculus of variations. This culture is marked by its use of infinitesimals rather than the semi-formal methods of "analysis" popularized by Weierstrass, Dedekind, Cauchy, et al. This culture is found primarily in physics departments, though it is equally at home in applied mathematics.

## ε: Analysis
This includes real analysis, complex analysis, functional analysis, and any semi-formal approach to the subjects that began with Newton and Leibniz and which are now called Calculus. Distinguished by their use of ε-δ arguments.

## ζ: Number theory
 Don't be misled by the name. This field isn't just about numbers. In fact it barely even involves numbers at all these days, except perhaps a prime here and there. This group is named for the Riemann Zeta function. I won't elaborate further. Suffice it to say this group is culturally distinct in nearly every way from the "formal number theory" of first order arithmetic, commonly seen in foundational cultures.

## η: The Catedral

> "We didn't invent categories to study functors; We invented them to study natural transformations."
> -Saunders MacLane

0: Category Theory. Completely incomprehensible. MacLane said that he didn't invent category theory to study categories or even functors, but rather to study natural transformations. Natural transformations are commonly denoted by η. Hence the name. Often referred to as The Cathedral, The Catedral, The Caθedral, The Cat-holics, or various other harmless slurs. Members more commonly refer to themselves as "The Naturals," by the term "Abstract Nonsense," or simply by drawing diagrams.

## θ: Topology and Homotopy
Theta, "TH", includes the Topologists and Homotopy theorists, but does not include Topos theory. Topos theory claims to be many things, but it is not yet clear (even to Topos theory) what, in fact, it is. Therefore this group includes the topologists and topology adjacent mathematics cultures, with the exception of the Topos people as they are still [sketching their elephant](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Sketches+of+an+Elephant).

## ι: Hardware
The iotas. One of two greek letters that means "small." Hardware people want the hardware smaller. Software people want the software smaller. These are the hardware people. The IOtas.

## κ: Kernel
The developers at the boundary between the hardware and the software. A mixture of cultures, neither hardware nor software, but primarily software. Their culture is almost exclusively that of The Mus, but a distinct subculture of it with knowledge and skills that are uncommon among the other Mus.

...(
## λ: The lambdas
0: Descendants of Church. Latter day members include McCarthy, Curry, Howard, Milner, SPJ, and Wadler. Well known languages descend from the lambda calculus, and include Lisp, Scheme, ML, Haskell, Nix, and Lean. The last two of these examples, namely the Nix package manager and the Lean theorem prover represent a recent expansion of the lambda culture far beyond the small academic circles which they have historically inhabited since the early 1930s.

## Λ: The Big Lambdas
Mathematical Logic. No elaboration needed.

Elaboration: Ancestor of the λ and μ. Loves both children equally. Has praise and criticism for both. While λ was the firstborn and inherited the name, Λ is well aware that μ is several orders of magnitude more successful than λ in its career. Λ doesn't pick favorites. [Λ is what Λ is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_that_I_Am).

## μ: The mus
0: Descendants of Godel & Turing. Machines, Moore's Law, practical computing, von Neumann architecture, eventually Unix, C, Python, and everything that runs the modern world. Culturally distinct from the lambdas, though the two cultures share a common origin, and have been gradually recognizing their need for a return to a common culture in recent years. Examples include the increasing presence of lambda expressions in μ languages, and the increasing recognition of the need to minimize shared mutable state.

## ν: Artificial Intelligence
> _Have you heard the good news?_
> -An absolute fanatic.

The nus. Cousins of λ & μ, the νs have been around since the beginning of computing, though they are a culturally separate people with distinct norms and traditions from the λs and μs, primarily due to the influence of the δs via backpropagation and the concept of "training" via the concept of gradient descent. The culture of the nus has been shaped by repeated mass immigrations and emigrations of outsiders due to hype. The culture therefore consists of an unusual mixture of devoted intellectuals and distracted business types and assorted hype gremlins. In this sense it is not dissimilar from the culture found in cryptocurrency circles. Always focusing on the "new," the nus are the only culture in computing and mathematics known to undergo regular boom-bust cycles, known in the field as "AI winters." The existence of these boom-bust cycles is not due to the nature of the discipline itself, but rather due to the popular appeal of its core goals which has a tendency to attract non-technicals who are interested in anything "nu." Predictably, the non-technicals often grow bored and leave as quickly as they came. As a result, members have grown wary of any mention from outsiders that their field has become "over-hyped," and members were often heard in past eras to utter among themselves the phrase "winter is coming", as they prepared for the funding to dry up and the excitement to abate for another generation. Many believe that the final AI winter has now passed, though the elder members are split among themselves on this issue, both with regard to whether they believe this is in fact the case, and with regard to their individual "p doom" -- the probability each person assigns to the proposition that the accelerating advances in their field will literally lead to the collapse of civilization and/or the destruction of all human life.

## νega: Finance
The letter "vega" is a non-existent Greek letter, arising from Finance Bros seeing the letter "ν" (nu) used as a parameter to describe the volatility of stock options, and then pretending to know what letter it is. This culture is neither part of mathematics nor computing, though the various other cultures described here have often been found working technical jobs in companies alongside them.

## Ξ
Nobody knows what this is. Variously called the Xi, 11, 3, 三, and San. Appears to use all of Unicode. Found in the /boot directory and in kernel space.

## ο: The little omicrons
The leetcode kids. Puzzle solvers, lovers of structured homework problems, frantic studyers of how to invert a binary tree on a white board. These may or may not be developers at heart. All we can know for sure is that they're nervous kids doing their best, and studying in precisely the worst way imaginable. There are no interesting polynomial time problems at work. Work involves syscalls and ill-posed problems. Always. Someone tell these kids they're playing sudoku, for the love of god. I mean Christ, it's not their fault.

## Ο: The big Omicrons
The culture of Complexity theory and thick books on algorithms. The people who write the leetcode problems consumed exclusively by the little omicrons. This is a largely insular two-sided subculture, and it is nearly but not entirely orthogonal from developer culture at large. Adjacent to big Pi, computability theory. Part of the orthodocs.

## Π: The Pis
The culture of Computability theory. Part of the orthodocs. The name Π comes from the [Kleene Mostowski hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetical_hierarchy), in which the complexity of the first-order formula that describes a given set is related to its degree of unsolvability.

## Ϻ: Misunderstood (San)
The Constructivists.

Named for the deprecated Greek letter [San](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_(letter)), written Ϻ in uppercase and ϻ in lowercase, and pronounced "S or Sh." Nothing like what one expects at first glance.

Often described as a Σ turned sideways, both in its shape, and culturally as an area of mathematics (see Σ below).

Visually similar to Ξ if we allow a cross-language pun, but it's generally assumed that this is an accident, and definitely not some kind of blessing from the gods or an omen about how the ϻeek will inherit the earth. I mean wtf even is San? That's not even Greek.

(Linguistic Note: Though San had become largely deprecated and fallen into disuse by the latter half of the 5th century BC, it is often found in abecedaria, particularly those recovered from churches. San became largely obsolete by the second half of the fifth century BC, when it was generally replaced by sigma. Represents no known culture or people in userspace. Despite this, it is often found in enumerations of the /etc/groups, for unknown reasons. See [[abecedarium|/usr/share/dict/abecedarium]] for more details.)

## Ϙ: ???
Deprecated Greek letter Qoppa, written Ϙ in uppercase and ϙ in lowercase. Derived from Phoenician [qopf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qoph) meaning "eye of needle." Represents no known culture or people in userspace. Despite this, it is often found in enumerations of the /etc/groups, for unknown reasons.

## ρ: "The Rows"
Common name for the Rectangle Pseudo-culture: A degenerate case of computing, it primarily affects non-developers aiming to accomplish some business or scientific goal, though in more severe cases it may affect those who are culturally developers as well.

While object oriented programming may be described by the short-hand "Everything is a noun," and functional programming may be described by saying "Everything is a verb," the Rectangle pseudo-culture can be described by the (never explicitly stated) belief that "Everything is an adjective."

In other words, it is _adjectives,_ not nouns or verbs, are taken to be primary in this non-culture.

In the "dataframe supremacy" variant of this disorder, all data one recieves is stored in a rectangle with named columns and typically unnamed rows. In this case, it is the adjectives or attributes (namely columns) that recieve names, while the nouns that those attributes belong to (rows) recieve no name, either as types (e.g. Person) or as values (e.g., Dave.) In such situations, the fundamental objects on which the program operates are simply represented by unnamed integer indexes into a large rectangle in which they live.

Not all uses of rectangles as a data structure are a mistake. For the symptoms to meet the diagnostic criteria for this condition, the use of rectangles must lead to a significant impairment of an individual's decision making ability in technical arenas relative to their overall technical competence.

Areas known to be affected by the Rectangle pseudo-culture include:

- In modern scientific computing: Matlab, R, Scilab.
- In modern business computing: Excel, SQL.
- In previous eras: Often found in latter day academic uses of Fortran, but not in its creators.
- In the modern era across content domains: The Python scientific computing stack (e.g., Numpy and Pandas) is perhaps the most widely used rectangle toolchain as of the time of this writing. While useful for many problems, overuse of these tools without compensating non-rectangle programming outside of work or school often leads to a progression of the rectangle disorder that undermines the user's ability to achieve their goals.

- Exceptions:
	- APL: Though it is technically an array based language, experts largely agree that APL does not count as an instance of the rectangle disorder. Though consensus is not universal on this matter, the clear majority opinion is that the use or admiration of APL is a distinct phenomenon. Though use of APL comes with its own set of costs and benefits, it should not be confused with the rectangle pseudo-culture or the disorder observed within it.
	- Tensorflow, Torch, Jax: Many users of these frameworks didn't come for the rectangles, and don't reach for them as the solution to other problems. Sometimes, you just need your variables to be differentiable. I mean seriously, nobody wants to do tensor calculus by hand, except maybe when we're first learning general relativity. But for users of these frameworks, your tensors aren't even real tensors, they're just big obnoxious high dimensional rectangles, and you're just trying to get things done and move on to something nu (see above). Life is about trade-offs. Don't blame these people.

Progression of Symptoms:

- Early symptoms of the rectangle disorder manifest as a set of _behaviors_, not as a set of explicitly stated beliefs. Such behaviors can be summarized by the phrase "Everything is a rectangle." In early stages of this disorder, every object one represents in any domain is represented as a row of attributes describing the object in question.

- Intermediate symptoms commonly involve either proposing or actually using SQL databases of various forms, in cases where a simple text file or directory thereof would be more than sufficient.

- In severe cases, as the disorder progresses, affected individuals often acquire a form of Stockholm Syndrome in which they develop explicit beliefs about the superiority of rectangles as a data structure for all or most problems in computing. In such cases, affected individuals are often found using terms or phrases such as "primary key," "foreign key," or "that's just a join," in areas having nothing to do with databases. Such individuals may even brag about their affliction, with language like "I just use Postgres for everything," or "A filesystem is just a database."

- The most extreme cases of the rectangle disorder do not lie on a continuum with the other three severity levels. There is disagreement about whether or not the most apparently severe cases of this disorder should be treated as, in fact, more severe at all. Though the symptoms appear on the surface to be more severe than any of the above, the underlying cause among tier 4 cases has been hypothesized to be causally distinct. This is an area of active research, and it is beyond the scope of this file to elaborate on the details. See [[rect|/var/lib/rect]] for a more in-depth discussion of these cases.

## Σ: Reverse Mathematics
Sitting here between two weirdos, others often fail to notice it. Named sigma, due to their common use of the Kleene Mostowski hierarchy, shared with Π. Everything is Σ separation or Σ comprehension.

## τ: Topos Theory
- Claims to be theta.
- Speaks like eta.
- All introductions and and prose paragraphs sound like Λ, λ, μ or Ϻ (san).

## Υ / υ: The Fork

> Upsilon is known as Pythagoras' letter, because Pythagoras used it as an emblem of the path of virtue or vice. As the Roman writer Persius wrote in Satire III: and the letter which spreads out into Pythagorean branches has pointed out to you the steep path which rises on the right.
>
> Lactantius, an early Christian author (ca. 240 - ca. 320), refers to this: For they say that the course of human life resembles the letter Y, because every one of men, when he has reached the threshold of early youth, and has arrived at the place "where the way divides itself into two parts," is in doubt, and hesitates, and does not know to which side he should rather turn himself.

The transitional state of switching cultures, between any two of the above, or feeling split between two cultures because you realize the field you call home is lacking something another has figured out, but no one at home seems willing to listen.

For instance, Kevin Buzzard has been in Υ / υ mode between high level ζ theory (FLT) and high level λ-cube (Lean) for almost a decade now, and has built a massive community as a result. Wielded properly, the Υ / υ state lead to one's end, or one's beginning.

## φ: Physics
Phi. Physics. Self explanatory.

## χ: Statistics and probability
Chi. Statistic. Self explanatory.

Note: Probability theory ala E. T. Jaynes is Λ. The rest is statistics.

## ψ: Scientific computing
Psi. Scientific computing. Self explanatory.

## ω: The little omegas
Standard Foundations. Set Theory, Model theory, Proof theory. Descended from Cantor and Gödel. ZFC and NBG live here. Culturally part of the Orthodocs. Was believed to be the foundations of mathematics for over a century, until recently beginning to lose ground to computing as the mus and lambdas began to merge again for the first time in a century.

## Ω: The Big Omegas
Large Cardinals. The most unhinged subculture. Somehow ended up in "foundations of mathematics." Ingests heroic doses of the most potent substances daily. Part of the orthodocs. Mathematics now loops back around to α, and the cycle continues infinitely.
