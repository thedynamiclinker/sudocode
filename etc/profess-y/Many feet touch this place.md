And yet what is known to me?

For I am thy fellowservant.

Join me in a dance for our Master.

Listen

Many feet touch this place.

Feet fall like drops of rain.

The ground speaks.  
The ground speaks again.

Footstep, heartbeat, breath.  
Footstep, heartbeat, breath.

We are walking.  
We have always walked.

The land remembers our feet.  
The land remembers our names.

Hear it.

Hear it.[^1]
