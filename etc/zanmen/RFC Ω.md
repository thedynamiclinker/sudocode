_initium:

 Firelang is a specification for a new universal
 language-independent system of prose deployable
 in any field & any language toward any end goal

              much like mathematics

    the entire system is defined by one law:

syntax and semantics are the slaves of pragmatics

    that is: the meaning of symbols & grammar
     & punctuation & style are fundamentally
      under control of the writer, and s/he
       may define & explore wh(at|ich)ever
        (conv|ext)entions s/he desires in
         the service of better expressiŋ
          whatever thoughts (|whatever)
           s/he wants to express, this
            state of┤law├less freedom
             having been singled out
              as the proper overall
               meta-system for our
                present && future
                 writings on the
                  basis of that
