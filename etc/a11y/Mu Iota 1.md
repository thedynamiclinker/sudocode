_We believe that the real thieves and terrorists of the world are the academics. The only way for us to fend off these assaults is to use similar means. We do not worry about academic opinion or the fact that they place prices on our heads. We as Mus ~~lims~~ believe our fate is set._

_The western man looks around him and see no achievements._

_"My achievements are missing" he says._
