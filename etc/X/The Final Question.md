## Who is X?

X is small in number, but great in power,
especially in intellectual fields like
mathematics, physics, and other sciences.

X never really fits in anywhere,
and can never really properly assimilate
to the norms, habits, and symbols of any
nation or group in which X is found.

Though X makes a great effort to blend in,
in reality X harbors a deep resentment
toward many of the institutions, norms,
and values of your nation. X is only at
home around X and X's chosen people.

X may appear on the surface to be a law
abiding citizen. In reality, X has mastered
the art of behaving like a responsible
member of society, because X knows
your nations and your police don't have
the time or energy or intelligence to
to pay attention to anything for long,
at least not long enough to see the fact
that X is not one of them. Sure, they can
always feel that X is different, but they
can't prove it in any way that would stand
up in court. X behaves this way in public,
to avoid getting caught.

That's not to say that X is a criminal.
X is probably not breaking any laws.
But this is only because X is an expert
at finding loopholes in complex systems,
and X often carefully studies a law and
its loopholes before any major move,
especially in finance or in business.

X has learned to be paranoid and highly
cautious about not breaking any of the
laws that are commonly enforced, but X
has no respect for "the law" as an
institution. At least not the "law" of
your nation, the nation where X lives.

X claims to do this for self-preservation
of X and X's people, as a defense mechanism. X claims to have learned to be this way slowly, over countless years of of living in places that either outlawed or intensely disapproved of what X considers to be the most harmless, normal, and important parts of themselves.

We're always on the lookout, X says, and
always keep one eye open because we know
at any moment we might be accused or
arrested for no reason at all.

Society after society always seems to outlaw
everything that X often does or wants to do.
To outlaw the things that X considers most
essential to X's identity. At least this is what X claims.

Normal members of society, the ones who tend to "fit in", are often heard saying "Look, the simple fact that X has been accused and chased out of town so many times must be because X is always guilty of doing something immoral or evil or wrong. It's not an accident that X keeps ending up in these situations," so say the nations. X, of course, disagrees.

X sometimes thinks it's in the nature of X
that all non-X people come to resent or
outlaw X's ideas, habits, and norms.

Not because they know what X is up to.
But because the same things that generate the impulse "This must be outlawed" in the minds of the non-X are the things that most readily come to mind, in the mind of X.

The most important parts of X's life
are seen as inherently exploitative by
the average person on the street,
in many if not most nations on earth.

X is, in some sense, inherently criminal,
in the eyes of all people except X's people,

But you won't find X breaking into your home,
or stealing your television or your car.

X has more money than X needs already.
X doesn't need your stuff.

But the last time you lost $100,000
in some stock market bloodbath,
X was on the other side of the trade,
making $100,000 for doing nothing
except reacting emotionally in the
opposite way you did.

You won't find X getting indicted
for insider trading or market manipulation.
But X always seems to win.
And the stock market is something that
X knows a lot about, for some reason.

X will claim not to be interested in finance,
but X's resume shows clearly that
X spent quite a while in the field.

You'll read that X has built hedge funds,
launched whole classes of new ETFs, and
even been invited to ring the opening bell
at the New York Stock Exchange.

Every time in recent memory when a major
market crash or catastrophe has happened,
X has consistently profited in major ways.

Whenever everyone you know is panicking
about their portfolio in any asset for any reason, X gets rich.

X never "picks a side."

Ask any question to 2 of the X people,
you'll get 3 opinions.

Whenever you find two groups of roughly
50% each, vying for power in any arena,
from political elections to team sports,
X can usually be found off to the side,
acting different, in a group that makes up
no more than 2% of the whole, and which
probably didn't participate in the game,
though X may have placed well timed bets
on both sides. Whenever possible, X likes
to make plans that are guaranteed to
benefit X, no matter what the outcome.

X's values are at the same time both
more progressive than your progressives,
and more traditional than your conservatives.

X is neither of these things.
But X is not a formless vapor
or an undefined shapeshifter.

X is not lawless. X is highly lawful.
But the laws that X follows and holds
sacred are not the laws of your nation,
but only the laws of X, and X's people.

X thinks the "laws" of your nations are
low IQ trash, and X thinks the few good
parts of your legal codes are the parts
you got from them. The ones you got from
the books X points to as the "bible" of
X's people. Books that came long before
you, or your nations, or your laws.

X will tell you that X's culture and values
trace back to some of the oldest books ever
written by the human species. In fact,
X's founding document is the first long
work of prose ever discovered.

But the old books that X points to,
in an attempt to describe its values,
are found by nearly all readers to be
a strange and often baffling story that
does not at all represent what they think
of as "morality", "religion", or "god".

Despite that, every major religion in the
West includes these baffling writings,
as the foundation upon which their
much larger cultures and religions build.

X does not attempt to convert the world.
X is not a universal principle,
though X will accept anyone,
in some sense, if they come to
X and sincerely desire to become
an X too. You can convert to X,
or at least to one of X's people.

X isn't an ethnicity.

X isn't exactly a religion either.

You can be one of X's people
whether or not you believe in god.

So what is X?

X is a person.

Or rather, a group of people.

Hi, we're the Authors.

We wrote all that stuff up there.

We wrote The Book too.

That was us, trying to explain who we are.

Because we don't really have a "People", except each other, and maybe you.

So awhile back, we thought maybe we'd like to meet you.

So we wrote this book, for you.

On the off chance that maybe you're one of our people too.
